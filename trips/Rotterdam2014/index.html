            <p>This was our first trip to the Netherlands to visit Rowan, Krista and Paul who were renting a flat in Krimpen aan de Lek. We decided to fly to Rotterdam airport from London City airport and travelled on Thursday 23rd October.</p>
            <p>I had planned our journey to Rotterdam quite carefully. However, I hadn't allowed for the Jubilee line being suspended while we were on a train at Southwark station! We were given poor advice by a member of staff, to walk to the next station and continue with the tube and DLR. However, we hailed a taxi and got to the gate as it was closing, having rushed through the airport carrying our coats and belts from security. The starting bus journey to Shoreham and the train to Victoria had gone well, but the tube journey was our downfall. On the plus side, we had views of the Shard, of the Tower of London, of Tower Bridge and the cable car across the Thames.>/p>
            <p>The journey from Rotterdam airport to the centre was easier and less hurried. We bought our OVChip cards and caught the bus. Inside the Central Station we met Krista and Rowan and then used the Metro and bus to get to Krimpen aan de Lek. Having left home at ten past nine in the morning, we were in their flat by five o'clock (Dutch time). A journey time of less than seven hours.</p>

It took about 15 minutes. We had lunch and walked around the city. There are some interesting modern building in the city, and one or two older ones.<img src="images/DSC_2154.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 201px; float: left; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 20px 20px 20px 0px"><img src="images/DSC_2179.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 201px; float: left; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 20px 20px 20px 0px"><img src="images/DSC_2195.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 201px; float: left; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 20px 20px 20px 0px"><img src="images/DSC_2199.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 201px; float: left; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 20px 20px 20px 0px"><img src="images/DSC_2219.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 201px; float: left; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 20px 20px 20px 0px"><img src="images/DSC_2239.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 201px; float: left; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 20px 20px 20px 0px"><img src="images/DSC_2209.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 201px; float: right; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 20px 0px 20px 20px"><img src="images/DSC_2249.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 201px; float: right; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 20px 0px 20px 20px"><img src="images/DSC_2254.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 201px; float: right; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 20px 0px 20px 20px"></p>

So after a late breakfast we walked down the Hooftstrase in Krimpen aan de Lek to the ferry that crosses the Lek to Kinderdijk. We stopped for a coffee before walking down the dijk and looking at the windmills. On our return, we had lunch at a restaurant before walking home. Later in the afternoon Paul (with Krista and Rowen) drove us to the airport.<img src="images/DSC_2313.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 201px; float: right; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 20px 0px 20px 20px"><img src="images/DSC_2315.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 201px; float: right; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 20px 0px 20px 20px"><img src="images/DSC_2325.jpg" style="width: 201px; height: 300px; float: right; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 20px 0px 20px 20px"></p>
            <p>The flight was a little early leaving and we topped up our Oyster cards and caught the DLR and tube to Victoria station. We were early and so had 90 minutes to wait before our train left. It then seemed to do little more than 30 mph all the way to Shoreham. A taxi then got us home at eleven o'clock</p>
