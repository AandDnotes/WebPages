        <h1>Rotterdam February 2016</h1>
        <div style="clear: both">
            <p>This trip to the Netherlands was the first since Paul et al had moved into the cottage at Berkenwoude. On Thursday 25th February, after an early lunch, we drove to Gatwick and caught the flight to Amsterdam. We had a sandwich at Schiphol before catching the train to Rotterdam and the Metro to Capelsebrug, where we met Paul. We arrived at their cottage at about 9:30.</p>

            <h3>The Cottage</h3>
            <p>Then next day, after not a lot of sleep we had a late breakfast and explored the garden before playing games with Rowan and having lunch. Then we went for quite a long walk 'around the block' before having dinner. The photos show the open plan living/dining/kitchen area and views from two of the windows. We then see us on our walk and finally a view of the outside, showing the builder's portaloo!</p>

            <h3>Rotterdam Zoo</h3>
            <p>We had a much better night's sleep and got up quite late. It was a fine, sunny, if cold morning and the forecast was for it to remain that way. So after breakfast, instead of having a shower, we all went off to Rotterdam Zoo. We had a spendid, if tiring, day there. The only fly in the ointment was a call from Alan to say that Dad had fallen over in the street yesterday and hurt his face. People from the chemists had cleaned him up and Alan had come down last night and will go home today. We had dropped Flo off at Greet and Wim's on the way, so on the way back we stopped to pick her up, eat lots of cake and sausage roll (in that order) and drink lots of coffee. We got back to the cottage just before it went dark.</p>

            <h3>The Barn</h3>
            <p>The builders were making good progress with the barn conversion. The floors were down and the stud partitions were going up.</p>

On Sunday, after taking a shower we went for a walk. The same walk as on Friday, but the other way round. We got back in time to have pancakes for lunch. Greet and Wim arrived just beforehand. They came to take Flo back for a couple of days, while the asbestos roof is being removed from the barn. After some games, Paul took us to Schiphol airport (taking the non-motorway route). We ate at the airport and arrived home at 11:30.<img src="images/DSC_3081.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 268px; float: left; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 20px 20px 20px 0px"></p>
