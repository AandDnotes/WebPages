            <p>Following a lot of effort to get Dad and Bay into their respective care homes for the duration of our holiday, we were picked up at 7:45 on the morning of Thursday 19th October and taken to Gatwick. The plane (a Boeing 777) took off at 11:15 (scheduled at 10:40) and we touched down at Oakland at 10:05 (UK time). We took the BART, firstly to Oakland Coliseum, where a football match was about to start between the local team and the Kansas City Chiefs (Brandon's home team), and then on to Richmond. There we transferred to the Amtrak train to Davis, arriving at 5:52. As we got off the train, so Victoria and Austin were there to meet us.</p>

From their house (complete with pumpkins) it is a mile to Austin's school. In the mornings he goes to a nursery school on the same site, going across to kindergarden after lunch. Victoria cycled on to take Juniper to pre-school while we walked home.</p>

            <p>We had a gentle morning and then Brandon came home and took us to Woodland for lunch.</p>

Brandon, who is the assistant coach for Austin's team (the Red Dragons), and Austin cycled to the park and the rest of us followed on foot. Austin's team (of four from a group of six) have one player who knows what he is doing. The rest run (or stand) around and kick the ball if they can (in any direction). Today, the other team scored lots of goals, but no one counts them! Later we walked to the nearest park, where Austin and Juniper played in the sand pit.</p>

            <h3>Yosemite</h3>
            <p><img src="images/Map01.png" style="width: 500px; height: 378px; float: right; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px">On Monday 23rd we collected a hire car from Hertz in Davis and drove to Yosemite National Park. We actually drove to Cedar Lodge, which is a few miles from the park boundary.</p>
            <p>We took the scenic route, marked in red on the map. Once we were off the Interstate we drove through small towns and along twisty roads, following Highways 16, 49 and finally 140. Overall the journey was 183 miles and took six and a quarter hours. We left the hire place at ten o'clock, a little earlier than we had expected, and arrived at Cedar Lodge at 4:15. We stopped at Angels Camp to buy some food and then parked a little further south at a view point at Carsons Hill to eat it.</p>
            <p>The road south of Coulterville was quite a challenge, being steep and twisty. Not only did it add more time to our journey, it was very tiring to drive. So we decided that for the return journey we would take the much more straightforward (and more boring) blue route shown on the map. That involved staying on Highway 140 and then heading north on Highway 99 to Sacremento. In spite of being two sides of a triangle, it was only 186 miles (the roads were much straighter) and only took 4 hours 55 minutes. The only difficult part was ording some food at a McDonalds at Atwater! Our round-trip jouney was 400 miles.</p>

            <p>Cedar Lodge was a pretty basic motel, with an expensive restaurant and a poor grill (where we ate on the first night). Strangely, not only did it have indoor and outdoor pools, but it had a landscaped area on the other side of the road, by the river. At least our room was about as far from the road as it was possible to be.</p>
            <p>Tuesday was really about finding our way into and around the park and doing some walking. We left for the park at about 10 o'clock, after having only a cup of coffee for breakfast. It took quite a while to get to the park entrance and then even longer to get to the valley. We started at the visitor centre and then had brunch at the deli. The process was to order your sandwich and coffee at a machine, wait for it to be prepared and then take it to the checkout and pay. It was another fine, warm (hot) day and so we sat outside.</p>

            <p>The above map shows the main points that are found in Yosemite Valley, which is only a small part of the overall park. After lunch we took the shuttle bus to stop 16, Happy Isles, and walked to Vernal Falls bridge. This was marked as 0.8 miles, but it didn't say that most of it was at 20% going up! We decided not to go to the top of the falls (another 1.3 miles), so descended and walked around the Happy Isles before catching the shuttle back to the village, where we bought some food for supper in the store. It took a long time to find a way to the car park, since all the roads around it had been re-surfaced! It then took even longer to get out of the park. We were back at the motel just after 5pm and ate our supper in our room.</p>

            <p>On Wednesday we left the motel at about 8:45 and drove firstly to Tunnel View to take photos. It was a little misty. We then went to the Bridalveil Falls car park and walked up to the view point. Then we went off to Half Dome Village, which is mainly set up for campers, parked the car and caught the shuttle to Yosemite Village. We looked in the gallery and the book shop and then had lunch as yesterday. From there we walked to Lower Yosemite Falls and then caught the shuttle to the head of the path to Mirror Lake. Only a little of the lake was left at this time of year. We then caught the shuttle back to Yosemite village to buy food and then on to Half Dome Village to retrieve the car and drive back to the motel. We drove 82 miles on the two return journeys into the park.</p>
            <p>Thursday was our day for returning to Davis. We left Cedar Lodge at 9:10, deciding to use a different route back to Davis so as to avoid the winding, steep road that we had travelled along on our journey to Yosemite. The route was boring by comparison, but took over an hour less travelling time. We got to Davis just after two, walked to Austin's school (and back) and then returned the hire car before Victoria collected Juniper.</p>

            <h3>The Big Sur</h3>
            <p><img src="images/Map02.png" style="width: 376px; height: 500px; float: right; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px">Friday, Saturday and Sunday were quiet days in Davis, including walking to Downtown, watching Austin's last soccer game of the season and food shopping. Then on Monday 30th October it was back to the car rental to start our excursion to the Big Sur. 
            Rather than drive all the way on Interstate roads we decided to turn off and go around the top of San Francisco Bay and then drive south on Highway 101 over the Golden Gate bridge. We stopped to buy lunch, which we ate (in a strong wind) overlooking the bridge and then drove over it into San Francisco.</p>
            <img src="images/DSC_3791.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 268px; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 0px 20px 20px 0px">
            <img src="images/DSC_3793.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 268px; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 0px 20px 20px 0px">
            <p><img src="images/DSC_3800.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 268px; float: right; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px">The bridge is a toll road, but you can only pay online or via telephone. So we emailed the licence number of the car to Victoria and she paid (we had to pay within 48 hours). We continued south, through the western suburbs of San Francisco, and joined Highway 1 down the coast, stopping at Half Moon Bay for the night.</p>
            <p>We chose Half Moon Bay since that was where we could turn inland and head for the Big Basin Redwood State Park. There were some fairly twisty roads, but the last part was very narrow for US-sized vehicles. We joined a guided tour of some of the redwoods, that started at 12:00, but did not finish until 1:30. The guide (a volunteer) was good, but it was quite slow going. However, we had an international group from Sweden, Germany, Switzerland and Parkistan (although now US), as well as us. There were many instances of the original tree having died, leaving a ring of 'child' trees. There are fires about every 100 years. However, Redwood bark is quite fire resistant, so the trees survive with only a little damage. Over the centuries (the redwoods can live for over 2,500 years) some trees get hollowed out by the fires. There was one that was followed right to the top, where the crown had broken off.</p>

            <p>After a late lunch we went for a short walk and then headed south to Monterey and found the Mariposa Inn &amp; Suites. From the road entrance it looked like a dump, but we were given a room with a separate lounge, on the third floor (US), so we could even see the Pacific Ocean (just) from our balcony. After a walk around the local shopping mall we went to the Crazy Horse restaurant (within easy walking distance) for dinner.</p>
            <p>On Wednesday we had breakfast in the hotel, walked across to Whole Foods to buy some sandwiches for lunch and then set off south down Highway 1 to the area known as the Big Sur. We stopped at various places to take photos of the coastal scenery, stopped for coffee at the Big Sur River Inn and then at the Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park. We followed a couple of trails around a bay where there was a waterfall (the McWay Cove waterfall), saw a humming bird and then had a picnic lunch. The other trail was closed, so we moved back further north to the Andrew Molera State Park (we could use the same parking ticket) where there was a path to a beach. What we didn't know was that we had to wade through the Big Sur River to get to the beach. The temporary 'seasonal' bridge had been removed the day before, so we had to take off our shoes and socks and wade through nine inches of cold water over a stony bed. The volunteer in the ticket office didn't tell us about this! However, we did see a stag crossing the path. We then drove back to Monterey and went out for a Chinese meal.</p>
            <p>The following is a selection of views down the coast, up to the classic shot of the Bixby bridge.</p>

            <p>For our journey back to Oakland airport we decided to catch the Amtrak train from Davis to Oakland Coliseum, from where we could take the BART to the airport. Being a small airport, there was no queue through passport control or security. Then the gate was just a few paces further. So we had a sandwich before boarding the plane (which was less than half full), which left on time at 3:35pm. We had a sleepless night, arriving half an hour early at Gatwick. Surprisingly we were through there quickly and arrived home at eleven o'clock.</p>
