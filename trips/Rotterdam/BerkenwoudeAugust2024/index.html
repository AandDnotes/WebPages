          <p><img class="photol-right" src="images/map.png">This trip was long in the making. Two years ago we all met at Menai Bridge on Anglesey and four of us went down with covid. So this was another atempt to get our family together, almost two years to the day after that try. It was April 2017 since we were all in Berkenwoude.</p>
          <p>Paul and Krista actually live in Akterbroek, about one kilometer from the village of Berkenwoude, which is about 20 kilometers to the west of Rotterdam.</p>
          <p>During this trip we visited Kinderdijk, Goude, Enkhuizen and Bruges. However, it didn't start well; the American's flight from Newark was cancelled and so they had to travel the next day, via Chicago! So they arrived on  Tuesday 6th August (rather than the Monday) and we arrived late on Wednesday.</p>
          <p>We took a taxi to Gatwick and flew to Schiphol, where we stopped for something to eat. We had taken plenty of Euros, but found that the cafe took cards only. Then, when I went to top up our OV Chip cards, I found that the ticket offices were closed, so I had to use a machine with my debit card. At least we checked that the card works in the Netherlands. We then caught the Intercity Express to Rotterdam and from there a train to Goude, where Paul picked us up. We got to Berkenwoude quite late in the day, but everyone was still up.</p>

          <h2 class="subheadingclass">Enkhuizen</h2>
          <p>On Friday 9th we set off with Victoria and Brandon at ten o'clock to go to Enkhuizen. When Brandon worked for Syngenta he would sometimes go there and his colleague (and later boss) lives and works there. Enkhuizen is as far north of Amsterdam as Berkenwoude is south, so it took one hour forty minutes to get there. It is on the Zeiderzee.</p>
          <p>Brandon had arranged to meet his friend, Renata, nearby an open-air museum. Luckily it had (almost) stopped raining when we got there. She came around the museum with us. We had some lunch in their cafe and later, when we went to the indoor part of the museum, Renata left us.</p>

          <p>The museum was a collection of buildings, brought from various parts of the region, and put together in the form of a village. The main activity was fishing, so there was a lot about smoking herring. At one time the area was the trade centre of northern Europe for herring.</p>
          <p>The indoor part had a collection of boats, costumes and furnishings, plus tales of local life and the reclamation of the Zeiderzee.</p>
          <p>Afterwards we went to a brewery so that Barndon could buy some beer, then walked around Enkhuizen before stopping for dinner. We got back at about 8:40. In the mean time, the rest had gone to the beach after dinner.</p>

          <h2 class="subheadingclass">Broken Arm!</h2>
          <p><img class="photol-right" src="images/park.jpg">Saturday 10th was another interesting day. We had a quiet morning, but after lunch we (Paul and I) cycled to the playground on the outskirts of Berkenwoude. Paul took the children in the box-bike and the others walked there. I was quite 'wobbly' on the bike. Just as the others arrived  Austin fell off the see-saw and hurt his wrist. We brought them home, gave him paracetamol and put his arm in a sling. Later, Krista phoned the hospital and they suggested taking him there in the morning.</p>
          <p>So Krista, Brandon and Victoria took Austin to the hospital in Goude on Sunday morning. They were back early, with Austin's bandaged arm in a sling and instructions to phone the X-ray department early in the morning.</p>
          <p>The next day, an x-ray showed that he had broken (cracked) both bones in his arm, near the wrist! So he was back before lunch with a blue plaster cast on his arm, which was in a sling, and instructions to go back on the day before they were due to leave.</p>
          <p>Over the next week Austin coped very well, using his left hand and just some fingers of his right hand. They went back to the hospital on the day that we left. In fact we passed them on the road shortly after we had left. Austin now had an orange plaster!</p>

          <h2 class="subheadingclass">Kinderdijk</h2>
          <p><img class="photop-right" src="images/Kinderdijk.jpg">On Wednesday 14th we thought that the children would like to cross the river Lek on a ferry and walk along Kinderdijk to see the windmills. Admittedly it was raining, just a little. Rowan said she had been there before, several times, Austin said it was boring and Juniper said it was too far to walk. Even an ice cream before we started walking along the dijk didn't help.</p>
          <p>Our plan was to go straight from Krimpen aan de Lek (the other side of the river where we had left the cars) to a restaurant on the banks of the Issel for dinner. We had booked a table for 6pm, but arrived at five. However, it took a while to order drinks and meals and we were there just before the place started to fill up. It was a good meal and everyone seemed to enjoy it, even if Rowan had to go outside after the main course and Austin and Juniper were wrestling while waiting for desert! Although this meal was our delayed Golden Wedding meal from 2022 we planned to pay for quite a few more meals.</p>
        <section>
          <h2 class="subheadingclass">Goude</h2>
          <p><img class="photol-right" src="images/Goude.jpg">Paul took Victoria, Brandon and I to Goude on Thursday 15th, mainly because it was market day. It was very busy, in fact the first car park that we tried (the nearest to the centre) was full. Paul bought some large stroopwafels on the market and we looked at the other stalls. There was a large display of big Goude cheeses, with an 'oompah' band playing in the middle. We walked around some of the side streets before going home.</p>
          <p>After lunch we gave Juniper her transfer picture kit, which she thought was magic, and Austin his 'tractor in a tin'. He was quite interested in that, although he needed help from Paul (and later Brandon) for the fiddly bits. I think they only got half way through the 60 steps!</p>

          <h2 class="subheadingclass">Cadzad</h2>
          <p>Krista had booked a big house, divided into three separate parts, but joined via lots of doors, on a sort of holiday development surrounding a large lake. So on Friday afternoon we all headed for Cadzad, on the coast near Belgium. All the houses are of the same style and there was a restaurant, shop, bar, small indoor pool, playground in the form of a wrecked ship, crazy golf and sports courts. One of the three parts of the house had a tower with a sort of mezzanine bedroom off one of the main bedrooms. That is where Rowan slept.</p>
          <p>On the first night we ate in the restaurant on site and then went for a walk to the beach, only about 600m away. There was a shipping lane between the shore and a wind farm, with a good procession of container ships and RORO ferries.</p>

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>The next day (Saturday) we drove to a very large beach about ten minutes away. It actually took longer to walk from the car park to half way between the dunes and the sea, the tide being a long way out. We stopped at an area of sand where Krista thought they might find 'shark's teeth'. Some dug in the sand and then went off to the water's edge, while we sat in a 'sand bench' and then later in a pop-up tent. It was a bit boring, but we left just before lunchtime, as the tide was coming in and people were retreating towards us. And they didn't find any shark's teeth!</p>

          <h2 class="subheadingclass">Bruges</h2>
          <p>On Sunday 18th we set off for Bruges, with a target of an underground car park near the centre. It only took just over half an hour. Having parked, we walked around the city, calling into the cathedral and the main square.</p>
          <div class="grid-container">
            <div class="item11">
              <img class="photop-leftg" src="images/Bruges1.jpg">

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>We then found one of the tour boat operators and booked a trip. We were at the back of the electric boat, with quite a lot of Japanese (or Korean or Chinese) people in front of us, all trying to take photos. However, it was quite a good way of seeing the city. The driver/skipper gave his commentary in about four languages (but not Chinese).</p>

          <p>We stopped for a meal in one of the many restaurants. It was fairly expensive, but good. Our intent had been to walk some more and then stop for waffles and ice cream. However, we didn't get very far before coming across a waffle shop that only sold gluten free waffles. So we bought a variety of ice cream waffle cones and waffles with chocolate mouse and ate them in the street. By this time all the main streets were heaving with tourists, with the occasional car and bus and many bicycles and horse-drawn carriages trying to get through.</p>

          </div>
          <p>The photo would have been better if the scooter rider had not appeared just as I pressed the button! We again stoped for coffee and hot chocolate at a cafe with outside space before returning to the car and driving back to Cadzand. </p>
          <p>On the afternoon of Tuesday 20th, Paul took us to Goude station to catch a train to Rotterdam and then the Intercity Express to Schiphol airport. Everything worked well and we were home just before nine o'clock, feeling very tired, but having had a good time with the family. Krista worked hard and did very well to feed us all and look after us for the two weeks.</p>
