        <h1>Rotterdam April 2015</h1>
        <div style="clear: both">
            <p>We got up early on Thursday 23rd April and drove to Gatwick. We arrived in good time, which was lucky, since it took me a long time to get through security. I inadvertently left my keys in my pocket and so was searched, thoroughly! Then my iPad was checked. Anyway, we arrived at Schiphol a little early, bought some filled rolls, added money to our OV-chip cards and caught the train to Rotterdam. We were earlier than planned, so we had a coffee (while waiting for Paul to join us) and then caught the metro to Capelsebrug where Krista collected us. Rowan was asleep in the car until we arrived at their apartment block. We spent the rest of the afternoon playing with Rowan.</p>

After a walk in the forest, followed by cake and coffee at a cafe with a closed kitchen, we went to Achterbroek. It was a very fine day, so we spent quite a long time there, looking around the garden. Rowan played on the trampoline and the tyre swing and managed to fill her shoe with sand. We then went back to their flat for a cup of tea before walking to the supermarket and the fish stall on the market. We bought some cooked pieces of fish, which we ate in a soft bread roll.</p>

Greet and Wim came over for coffee (and cake) and we had an early lunch. Then we went to Achterbroek ein to look in the upstairs of the barn. We had to climb a ladder to get up there. The thought of converting it is quite scary! From there we went to Greet's for coffee before going to a pancake house in Krimpen an der Issel. When we got back to Paul's flat we spoke to Victoria and Austin before reading Rowan her bedtime stories.</p>

We got up late and played games with Rowan. After lunch we went for a walk around some parkland on the edge of Krimpen, just a few minutes from their flat. Meanwhile, Krista went to her sister-in-law's baby shower. At six o'clock Paul drove us to Schiphol airport. We had a hot roll and some fruit at a kiosk near the departure gate and caught our 08:55 flight to Gatwick. We arrived home to a dark and not very warm house at 10:30 UK time.</p>
