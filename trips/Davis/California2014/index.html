            <h3>Sunday 23rd November</h3>
            <p>What a long day! We got up at six and was picked up by taxi at 7:30 to take us to Heathrow. The flight to San Francisco was long, with a very turbulent patch. I thought that I would need to use the paper bag! At SFO we bought our 'green' BART tickets and caught the train into SF. Then a short walk to the hotel, the Kensington Park, the lower floors of which are covered in scaffolding. The lobby and exterior is of a Spanish style and our room has a large, Spanish-style ceiling fan, which helps to keep it cool. We went to bed at 7:30, but that was like 3:30 in the morning.</p>

We started with breakfast in a small cafe a few doors from the hotel and then walked down to the start of the cable car route at the bottom of Powell Street. We took that all the way to the end, near Fisherman's Warf, and walked back, up the hill, to Lombard Street. The island in the phot is Alcatraz and the other view (from the top of the crooked road) is towards the Coit Tower.</p>
            <p><img src="images/DSC_2360.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 198px; float: left; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 0px 20px 20px 0px">We then walked down the crookedest road. We returned to the bay, walking firstly around past the maritime museum and then back past the piers. It is like Blackpool, but without the tower and the pleasure park! We walked back to a small bakery we had passed and had a good (small) lunch.<img src="images/DSC_2362.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 198px; float: right; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 20px 50px 0px 20px"><img src="images/DSC_2366.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 198px; float: left; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 0px 20px 20px 100px"></p>

Splendid views all around. Finally we walked through China Town, back to the hotel, exhausted and wondering what to do tomorrow!<img src="images/DSC_2368.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 198px; float: left; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px"><img src="images/DSC_2379.jpg" style="width: 198px; height: 300px; float: left; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: -50px 0px 20px 200px"><img src="images/DSC_2382.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 198px; float: left; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: -40px 0px 20px 130px"></p>

Parts of Market Street are run down and were quite scary. We then walked up Steiner until we came to Alamo Square and saw the 'painted ladies'. Then we went on to Pacific Heights and Cow Hollow, before walking up to the bay just west of Fort Mason. We walked over seven miles! So after some lunch we rode the cable-car back to Market Street. We had quite a long wait in the queue, but the ride was quite exiting since we were sat outside at the front.<img src="images/DSC_2385.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 198px; float: left; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 20px 40px 20px 20px"><img src="images/DSC_2387.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 198px; float: left; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 0px 100px 20px 20px"></p>
            <p>We then walked round the shops (I bought a belt in Macy's), before going to an Italian restaurant. We only gave them a 10% tip since they served the coffee before the desert!</p>

            <h3>Wednesday 26th November</h3>
            <p>We were up early this morning and at the cafe next to the hotel for breakfast before they had squeezed the oranges! So we caught an earlier BART train than we had planned. We arrived at Richmond a few minutes before the earlier train was due. Then it was a few minutes late and so we were able to catch it, in spite of having bought a ticket for the later train. Luckily the Amtrak trains have wi-fi and so I could send a message to Victoria. She then collected us from Davis station.</p>
            <p>Austin and Brandon were waiting for us when we got to Catalina Drive. We had some lunch and then went for a walk around the local park areas. Then playing with Austin tired us out!</p>

We slept quite well and so did not get up very early for our pancake breakfast. The morning was spent not doing very much. But after lunch we went for a walk in the sunshine, visiting a couple of playgrounds. Meanwhile, the Turkey was cooking. We then had pomelo as a started, a turkey dinner and pumpkin pie. For most of the day the TV was showing the various football matches that were being played across the country.<img src="images/DSC_2415.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 198px; float: left; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 20px 20px 20px 0px"><img src="images/DSC_2417.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 198px; float: left; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 0px 20px 20px 20px"></p>

So we had a late breakfast, followed by a walk into downtown Davis. There we had some lunch before spending longer than planned in a playground! We walked back via a supermarket, drank tea in the back porch and then swept up leaves in the back and the front, leaving them in piles in the road. I then watched a film before we went to bed.<img src="images/DSC_2425.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 198px; float: left; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888; margin: 20px 20px 20px 0px"></p>

            <p>It rained for most of the day today, so we stayed in. We got up late and after breakfast spoke with Paul et al. Then we did some washing and played with Austin or read for the rest of the day.</p>

            <h3>Sunday 30th November</h3>
            <p>It didn't rain as much today, although we still had a lazy day. We got up late and played with Austin this morning. Then we went firstly to Target and then to Nugget. The first to look for some wellie boots for Austin (but they didn't have any) and to buy two jumpers, a dressing gown and a hair dryer for Victoria. We also bought some paints for Austin. At Nugget we bought some groceries, including a jar of sauce to use with the left over turkey. We managed to prevent Austin from going to sleep. Although he didn't eat much lunch, he did quite well for dinner, doing some painting beforehand. Then he had a relatively early bath before stories and bed. Victoria's cold, however, is quite heavy.</p>

So we got up late and drove to Woodland for lunch. In so doing we drove past the Syngenta site. We also saw where they had lived before moving to Davis.</p>
            <p>I booked a B&amp;B in Placerville for the next two nights, even though it is going to be very wet.</p>

A red Ford Fiesta. We then set off along Interstate 80 towards Sacramento. Then on to US50 for a short while before turning off on to California 16 and joining 49, which would take us to Placerville. We stopped for a coffee at Plymouth before going on to Placerville, where we arrived at around one o'clock. The Sacramento valley is very flat, but the drive from Plymouth to Placerville was more interesting, since there were real hills and winding roads. We had lunch in Placerville and then walked the length of Main Street, in the rain! Our feet got quite wet. The B&B seemed quite adamant that check in was not until four o'clock, so we sat in the car until then! After a glass of wine and a look at the menus of various restaurants, we walked across the footbridge to Main Street and went to a Mexican restaurant.</p>

We then walked down to the town. We went into the hardware store; quite an amazing shop; and bought a small wooden rolling pin and a Christmas-tree decoration. We then went on to look around the small museum. After that, we returned to the B&B and drove to an apple farm and to a winery. The first apple farm was very disappointing, being little more than a large shed with some apple-based products for sale. The second was a little better in that they had some picnic tables under cover. So we stopped for a coffee and a cake. We then went on to the Madrona winery, where we tasted several red and white wines and bought three bottles to take back to Victoria's. From there, we returned to Placerville and went up 49 to Coloma, where the Californian gold rush started. Quite a nice bendy road. But it started raining heavily when we got there, so we drove around a scenic route in the hills. Steph at the B&amp;B said we were 'brave' to drive that route. By the time that we got back to Coloma the rain had eased and so we stopped for a coffee before heading back to Placerville. Later, after a glass of wine, we walked down to the town for a meal (in the Buttercup Pantry where they served 'lighter', but uninspiring dishes.</p>

It started as planned. We had breakfast, packed and set off on back roads towards a place called Folsom (I forgot to take a photo on my phone, so couldn't upload any). Folsom has a huge reservoir and an old town. The journey took less time than we thought and so we were back in Davis for lunch, arriving back at Victoria's at about 2:30.  We decided to take the hire car back and then pick up Austin. Then the fun started.</p>
            <p>When we got to Downtown Davis, the police had closed it off! It seems that there was a demonstration taking place. So we could not get to the car hire place! We got a little lost on the University campus and then phoned the hire company. But their suggested route was also blocked off. Eventually we persuaded the police to let us into a garage forecourt and out the other side into the road we wanted. We then had to walk to the railway station (about 20 minutes) to meet Victoria (and Austin). The whole episode took about two hours.</p>
            <p>However, we had a good meal when we got back and now Austin is in the bath.﻿</p>

It only takes 15 minutes, but we went on the upper deck and Austin was really engrossed. We looked at Sacramento Old Town and the State Capitol building. We were back in Davis by four o'clock.</p>

So after breakfast we drove to Woodland and spent two and a half hours watching the parade. Entertaining, but a little long, although it did finish with Santa on a fire engine!.</p>
            <p>We went home for a late lunch and then went to Trader Joe's to buy some food and a cool bag.</p>
            <p>In the evening I was able to watch the two episodes of Shield that I will miss due to being away.</p>

We caught the 10:25 Capital Corridor train to Richmond, where we changed to the BART. We changed trains at Powell so as to go to SFO. We had some confusion over the terminal, but we had plenty of time and then found that the flight was delayed by an hour! The rest of the (short) day was spent on the plane.</p>
