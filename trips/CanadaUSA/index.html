            <p>During the summer of 2024, Victoria, Brandon, Austin and Juniper came over from New Jersey to the Netherlands. We joined them and had a good holiday with them and with Krista, Paul and Rowan (even if Austin did break his arm). You can see some details <a href="https://aanddnotes.github.io/WebPages/trips/Rotterdam/BerkenwoudeAugust2024/index.html">here</a>.</p>
            <p>However, towards the end of 2024, Brandon's company went out of business and he accepted a job in Ontario, Canada; on the Niagara peninsular. So in a very short time they sold their house, rented one in Beamsville and they emigrated.</p>
            <p>This was good news to us, since we had always wanted to take the Rocky Mountaineer train across the Canadian Rocky mountains. So we booked that, along with the travel from Toronto to Banff and then from Vancouver home. Finally we booked the flight from Gatwick to Toronto.</p>

          <p><p>However, our plans were slightly thwarted, since Brandon decided that his new job did not match his expectations and he was offered a job at another vertical farm company (80 Acres) in North West Arkansas.</p></p>
          <p> Within two weeks of the job offer they had found somewhere to rent in Fayetteville and left Canada. The house wasn't available immediately, so Brandon moved into an Air B&amp;B in Arkansas and Victoria and the children moved in with Brandon's parents in Lee's Summit, near Kansas City, until the rented house was available.</p>
          <p>So we had to amend our plans. We booked a hotel for a few days in Toronto, along with a flight to Kansas City and a flight from North West Arkansas back to Toronto. The plan was that we would spend a hew days in Lee's Summit with Brandon's parents, then Victoria would drive us and the grandchildren to Fayettevile. After a few days there we would fly back to Toronto and continue our original plan to fly to Calgary, take the bus to Banff and catch the Rocky Mountaineer to Vancouver.</p>
          <p>Overall, we spent seven days of our three weeks holiday travelling!</p>
