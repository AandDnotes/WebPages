                <h1>2022</h1>
                <p>In a way, this year was one of death and disease! Queen Elizabeth II died on 9th September and Dad died on 3rd June, with his funeral at the end of the month. Then Angela and I caught Covid in August.</p>
                <p>It was also a year of destruction and closure. In February Paul lost part of his roof in storm Eunice and Russia invaded Ukraine. Also in that month Angela's WI branch closed and I stood down as Chair of the IET Sussex Network. Our fatalist agenda continued in March when we both made new wills and set up funeral plans!</p>
                <p>There were plenty of positives. In May we had the walled garden slightly re-worked, with new patio and paths around to the front. We also had a week with Paul, Krista and Rowan in Berkenwoude. Then in July we had two trips to Chichester, one for a canal triip with the WSMGOC and then to see ‘Crazy for You’ at Chichester theatre. Towards the end of the month Victoria, Brandon, Austin and Juniper visited. After a few days we drove to Anglesea, stopping on the way at Stourbridge. The day after our arrival at Menai Bridge, Paul et al joined us, having flown to Manchester and hired a car. Two days later Brandon and I tested positive for Covid and Angela and Victoria were also ill. Paul et al changed their plans and flew home, so our planned 50th wedding aniversary celebrations didn't happen! We had recovered in time to drive home.</p>
                <p>Later in August we drove to Alan’s for lunch and then on to Collingham to visit Kate and Dick. However, adding to the disasters, I stripped the thread on one of the MG's carburettors and so had helicoils fitted to both. Consequently we missed the South Downs Run, just marshalling at the start.</p>
                <p>At the end of September we signed up for Virgin Media full fibre internet at a very good introductory rate, although it will go up a lot after 18 months. We also planted three trees, well whips, in the front garden and an espalier cooking apple tree in the walled garden. In November I had my heart monitored for 24 hours and, as a result, my medication changed.</p>
                <p>Finally we spent a pleasant week in Berkenwoude for Christmas with Paul, Krista and Rowan.</p>
