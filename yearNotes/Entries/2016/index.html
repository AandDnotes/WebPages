                <h1>2016</h1>
                <p>It was a year of drives in the TC, STEM events, mainly in the form of IET stands at mini-big-bang fairs, and visits to and by the children.</p>
                <p>Apart from finding that the stub axles on the TC had been installed on the wrong sides, I also discovered cracks in the spindles. This resulted in importing new ones from Canada and getting someone in Guildford to fit them in the knuckles in July. This set the TC up well for the South Downs Run at the begining of September. A 134 mile round trip. Later, in September, I changed the rubber bushes in the springs on the TC, which made the steering much more stable.</p>
                <p>The early part of the year didn't start too well when Bay was taken into hospital. She wasn't there for too long, but returned home while we wer away visiting Paul in February. This was just a long weekend visit, but while visiting Rotterdam Zoo I had a call from Alan to say that Dad had fallen on his way back from the shop and grazed his knees and face. We were also in Berkenwoude in mid July and then again at the beginning of November. In between, they came here in October and were back in December for Christmas.</p>
                <p>During the second half of April we had a visit from Victoria, Brandon and Austin. Whilst here they visited Paul and Krista in Berkenwoude and Brandon came  with me on Drive It Day in the TC.</p>
                <p>We also had visits from Dick and Kate in mid-March and November, with us visiting them at the end of July.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the biggest event of the year was the UK voting to leave the European Union!</p>
