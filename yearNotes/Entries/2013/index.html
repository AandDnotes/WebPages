                <h1>2013</h1>
                <p>At the end of January we decided to have a week in the sun and so went to St Kitts in the Carribean. It was interesting, relaxing and warm. Otherwise we continued with our visits to Twickenham and Binfield to visit Rowan and Austin.</p>
                <p>In April I jouned the Sussex Radio Flying Club, who use a flying site on the top of the Downs above Steyning. I bought a trainer aircraft from another member, complete with 35MHz transmitter and receiver. My journey on this renewed hobby is recorded in a <a href="http://myrcjourney.blogspot.co.uk">blog</a>.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most notable event occurred on the 1st July, when I retired. My colleagues gave me a smart phone and a Raspberry Pi. Then, towards the end of August, we had another one-week holiday on the Isle of Wight.</p>
                <p>Since we really now only needed one car, in October we swapped the Modus for a new Fiat Panda and in November I sold the MGF. Quite sad, since I'd owned it for 12 years.</p>
