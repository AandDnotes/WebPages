                <h1>2024</h1>
                <p>2024 was a busy year. Some of this was due to hospital/clinic appointments, some associated with trying to sell the TC and some visiting friends and family.</p>
                <p>Early in the year Angela went through the process of having new grommets fitted in her ears, only to be advised at the last minute not to have them done. The next month, I on the other hand, had cataracts removed from both eyes.</p>
                <p>Having decided to sell the TC I took it to a number of classic car shows, complete with a discrete ‘for sale’ sign. Some interest, but no takers. So I arranged for the car to be ‘housed’ at Milestone Classics in Wisborough Green and for them to advertise it. By late autumn it had still not sold.</p>
                <p>Over Easter we went to Paul’s in Berkenwoude and visited Christine and Alan for a barbecue in late June. Then in August we were back in Berkenwoude, this time with Victoria et al. Apart from Austin breaking his arm we had a good time, spending a few days on the coast near the Belgian border and visiting Bruges. Then we met up with Kate and Dick in Sudbury for a few days before going back to Berkenwoude for Christmas.</p>
