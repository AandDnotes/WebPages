                <h1>2017</h1>
                <p>In January I started building a model Tiger Moth, but over the year I only managed to get part-way through building the fuselage. However, in April I bought a glider at the club auction, but have not yet found the opportunity to fly it.</p>
                <p>The main event in April was a visit by Victoria, Brandon, Austin and Juniper. While they were here we all went over to Berkenwoude to visit Paul, Krista and Rowan. Victoria et al stayed in the cottage and we slept in the Barn. Later, in August, Paul, Krista and Rowan came to visit and then at the end of October we went over to California. Whilst there we visited Yosemite National Park and took a drive over the Golden Gate Bridge and down Highway 1 to the Big Sur.</p>
                <p>While we were away, Bay and Dad went into respite care. When we returned Dad decided to move into Victoria Grand permanently. He'd had a short spell in hospital in August, after which we set up some home care visitors. Then, in December on way back from an appointment at Southlands, I took Dad into Worthing A&amp;E since he was feeling unwell. They kept him in, but he was discharged on Christmas Day morning! Paul, Krista and Rowan were here for Christmas, so they were able to visit Bay in hospital as well, since she had been admitted in November.</p>
                <p>Kate and Dick came to visit in July. Then we met them at Wisley in November, actually going in this time.</p>
                <p>I did a few small jobs on the TC as well as going on runs. I designed and built an electronic flasher unit, changed the bushes in the distributor and stripped down the wiper motor. Then in August, after a run to Goodwood, I found oil in the rear brake drums. It took until November to get the car back on the road after major work on the back axle.</p>
