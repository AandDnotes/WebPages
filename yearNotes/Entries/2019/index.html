                <h1>2019</h1>
                <p>The main activity this year was our move from Kingsmead Close into Penlands Vale. On 30th April, after 19&frac12; years in Kingsmead Close, we finally moved. This was a serious downsize! However, the move went smoothly and we fitted.</p>
                <p>We spent the final three weeks of August in California, visiting Victoria et al. It was really too hot for us at that time of the year, but they had a small (ten feet in diameter), circular, above-ground pool on their patio, in the shade of the canopy. Juniper turned out to be quite a water baby. The middle week was spent near Lake Tahoe. Victoria had booked a chalet just to the south. The weather was still hot, but a little cooler than in Davis. Whilst there we had a good trip on a paddle steamer across the lake.</p>
                <p>When we moved into Panlands Vale we knew that the bathroom was very dated and did not have a shower. The downstairs cloakroom (using the same range of sanitary ware, tiles and paint as the bathroom) does have a shower, under the stairs! Rather than attempt to fit a shower over the bath we decided to refit the bathroom completely, replacing the bath with a large shower tray. So on Monday 21st October the plumber arrived. However, it was seven weeks later before he had finally finished! Then we had to paint the bare plaster ceiling and walls.</p>
                <p>Last year we spent a slightly belated Christmas in Davis with Victoria et al. This year we went to Paul's, only from Monday to Friday, since Christmas Day was on the Wednesday. Greet and Wim came over for Christmas Day and our dinner took the form of us each cooking various types of meat on a large hotplate. We had a good week and returned home for New Year.</p>
