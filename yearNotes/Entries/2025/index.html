                <h1>2025</h1>
                <p>2025 seems to have been plagued by travel issues. We ended the year in the Netherlands, when we had expected to be home. Our return Eurostar train was cancelled due to a power problem in the Channel Tunnel.</p>
                <p>We had been to Berkenwoude over Easter travelling by plane on that occasion, but thought that the train would be more relaxing! During the summer our main outing was to Canada. Victoria et al had emigrated to Canada (about 15 miles west of Niagara Falls) when Brandon’s company went out of business and he was offered a job at a research establishment in Ontario. So we planned a visit to them, going onward to Banff and a train journey across the Rockys to Vancouver. Unfortunately , by the time of our trip they had moved to Arkansas! So we stayed in a hotel in Toronto, flew down to Kansas City and then on to Fayetteville and flew back to Toronto to get our flight to Calgary. Once again it was unfortunate that the flight was cancelled, we were re-routed via Montreal, our bags didn’t arrive and we missed the last bus to Banff! It was all very tiring, but overall we had a good time.</p>
                <p>In September our trip to Norfolk to meet Kate and Dick went well. A few days before that I’d taken the TC on the South Downs Run on my own. The car ran well and I only got a little lost. However, in October I sold the TC to a couple from the Netherlands, with an invitation to visit when we can. To fill the space in the garage I bought a 1972 MGB in November. I still have a lot to find out about it.</p>
