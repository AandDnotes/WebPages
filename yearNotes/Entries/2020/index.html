                <h1>2020</h1>
                <p>This was the year of the COVID-19 pandemic! Having first been reported in China, the virus gradually spread westward, arriving in Britain in February and by March we were in our first lockdown. So all the events that we would have attended were either cancelled or moved on to Zoom. Our biggest fear was what would happen if either of us caught the virus. Otherwise, not being able to leave home, other than to do food shopping or take some exercise, did not impact us too much, and we did quite a few walks from home. I couldn't visit Dad at Victoria Grand, but at least I could talk to him on the phone or occasionally via FaceTime.</p>
                <p>Things were eased over the summer months, but our planned family get together in Wales was postponed for a year. But then in November we were back into lockdown. This was eased in time to give everyone a chance to do their Christmas shopping, but then the third lockdown started on Boxing Day. Overall, decisions to lockdown seem to have been taken too late. Also, a test and trace system, that was used to good effect in other countries, was late and pretty ineffective. Many couldn't afford to self-isolate if they were tested positive and many people did not display symptoms and so were not tested.</p>
                <p>In the Netherlands Paul was working from home and Rowan, at various times, was doing 'home schooling'. It was much the same in California, except that Brandon got a new job, in New Jersey, and in the summer they moved, driving across the country. Austin was struggling at school anyway, but home schooling did not work for him.</p>
                <p>Most governments, including the UK, were borrowing lots of money and paying people to stay at home. So the economy was taking a big hit. However, several vaccines were in trials after only months of development. So this was seen as our way out of the pandemic.</p>
