                <h1>2011</h1>
                <p>2010 ended with the celebration of Angela’s Mother’s 100th birthday. Unfortunately she was in hospital at the time and then was moved to a nursing home in Henfield where she died peacefully in her sleep on January 28th. During the week of the funeral, Pip had another relapse. He did not survive and so we now find home quite a different place.</p>
                <p>So 2011 did not start particularly well. We went through the probate process (which was not too onerous) and I spent a week in the US in February (in the snows of Massachusetts). However, a short holiday in Madeira at the beginning of April and a week in Devon at the beginning of September helped a lot.</p>
                <p>Also in September, both Victoria and Krista announced that they were pregnant; within two weeks of each other! But neither told the other until they had been for their 25 week scan, so we had to keep the secrets.</p>
