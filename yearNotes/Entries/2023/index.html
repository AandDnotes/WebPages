                <p>Looking back, there were quite a lot of trips/outings this year. We went to Alan’s twice, once for Christine’s birthday and then later for a halloween party. During the first trip we also went on to meet up with Kate and Dick for lunch. We then met them again, this time for a few days, in Bury St Edmunds in September.</p>
                <p>Angela met up with her friends in Guildford and we spent a week with Paul et al in Berkenwoude, where we went again for Christmas.</p>
                <p>However, our biggest trip was to visit Victoria et al in New Jersey, where they had moved in early 2021. We started by flying to Boston for a few days and then caught the train down to New York and then out to New Jersey. The whole trip was very good (apart from picking up a heavy cold on the train from Boston), although we found parts of New Jersey too hectic.</p>
