                <h1>2015</h1>
                <p>By the end of March I finally finished building the Piper Cub plane from the kit that I had bought in 2013 and started building in April 2014. On April 7th I gave it its maiden flight.</p>
                <p>I looked at several 1948 MG TCs before, at the end of June, we went to Essex to look at TC4985; and bought it! I had planned to drive it home, but was persuaded to get it transported. So a week later I went with the transporter driver to collect it. I then had fun taking bits off and putting them on again!</p>
                <p>Bay was 100 in June! Then at the end of the month we had a good week in Cornwall with Paul, Krista and Rowan who came over from Rotterdam. They then came back to us for a few days before driving home.</p>
                <p>By the time August arrived we had to set up a schedule of carers to visit Bay in the morning, lunch time and evening to give her the help that she needs on a daily basis. Also, on Saturday 22nd, an historic jet crashed at the Shoreham air show, killing 11 people. At the end of the month we had a good weekend in Badby with Kate and Dick.</p>
                <p>Early in September, with the MG's radiator still out, I helped steward at the 'South Downs Run' at Eastbourne. There were about 200 MG taking part.</p>
                <p>On 24th September Juniper was born. A week later, at the beginning of October, we set off for California to visit Victoria et al for two and a half weeks. We stayed in Davis, just helping out as best we could.</p>
                <p>In November I went on the first of my MG runs with the Sussex Wanderers and then had a day out with Hamish and Simon at the Classic Car Show at the NEC..</p>
                <p>In December Paul, Krista and Rowan came to visit for Christmas.</p>
