                <h1>2014</h1>
                <p>In April I started building a semi-scale model of a Piper Cub. The original aim had been to build it over the winter, but the kit did not arrive until the Spring! So, in fact, I didn't get it finished in time to fly it this year. I had also bought some small (3.3V) Arduino micro-controllers and some RF modules and continued to experiment with my own design of a 2.4 GHz radio control transmitter/receiver.</p>
                <p>We decided that our kitchen, which I had installed when we first came here 25 years ago, was in need of upgrading. So during May it was ripped out, new flooring layed, rewired and re-fitted. We hope to get some use from it before we downsize.</p>
                <p>At the end of May we took Rowan and Austin (and their parents) to Drusilla's Park. This was just before Victoria, Brandon and Austin went off to live in California. Paul, Krista and Rowan went to live just outside Rotterdam in September. Brandon's company relocated him to their Woodland site and Paul got a job with a Dutch online supplier of electrical goods. We inherited Sam, Victoria's cat, but Paul took their cat with them. Victoria et al rented a flat in Woodland and then bought a house in Davis. Paul et al rented a flat in Krimpen aan de Lek and then bought a Barn (with attached cottage) on the outskirts of Berkenwoude. We visited Paul towards the end of October and Victoria towards the end of November. We took the opportunity to have a few days in San Fransico on the way and also went off towards the hills to the east for a few days.</p>
                <p>When Victoria went to California she left us her car to sell and when Paul came over for Christmas he did the same!</p>
