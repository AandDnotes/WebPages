                <h1>2018</h1>
                <p>The year didn't start very well. Dad had moved into Victoria Grand and so was being looked after, but Bay died in hospital in January. Sorting out her estate then took a lot of effort and her bungalow was still for sale at the end of the year. It was June before we finally settled the inheritance tax bill.</p>
                <p>In February the new owner of the wood ripped up the trees and shrubs (apart from those that have preservation orders on them). Also, Dad was back in hospital with the flu. Luckily only for a few days.</p>
                <p>We sold Dad's bungalow in March, with completion in April. Alan came down to help clear the 'rubbish', but the purchaser wanted to complete before the rest of the house was cleared.</p>
                <p>In April we had our first visit to Berkenwoude via Eurostar. We had an excellent day visiting the Keukenhof to see the tulips. This was a birthday trip for Angela. We were both 70 this year.</p>
                <p>Mid July saw us travel to Dorset to meet up with Paul, Krista and Rowan. We stayed for a week in a cabin on a holiday site, only a field away from the beach. We did fossil hunting, walking and playing in the sand.</p>
                <p>For three weeks during August Victoria, Austin and Juniper came to visit. We had lots of train journeys, including one to Rotterdam to visit Rowan for a few days.</p>
                <p>We took the TC on the South Downs Run at the beginning of September. 136 miles from home to Whiteways, to Eastbourne along the lee of the Downs and then back along the coast. A warm, sunny day with not a cloud in the sky and light winds.</p>
                <p>Austin had a US passport and Juniper obtained a UK passport, but this year was the year that Victoria became a US citizen.</p>
                <p>In September some friends told us of a small house with a large garage that was coming on the market. So we looked at it. It ticked most of the boxes, but was a 1970s A-frame house on a large housing estate. Another major activity in September was to remove the head from the TC's engine, clean it and replace the valve stem oil seals. Later I cleaned and painted the underside of the wings and running boards.</p>
                <p>During October, Krista bought a pony (Freda) and her foal (who they call Moon). Later they discovered that Freda was in foal! So in November we made another trip to Berkenwoude. This time we flew.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>In December I travelled to Warrington for the funeral of a University friend! I also fitted an oil seal to TC's steering box, although I didn't test it until the New Year. This was mainly because we went to Davis for Christmas, or at least we tried to. On the day of our departure, drone sightings at Gatwick caused all flights to be cancelled. So we were a week late for Christmas!</p>
