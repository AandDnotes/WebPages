                <h1>2021</h1>
                <p>This year was still dominated by Covid-19, although restrictions were relaxed during the summer as the number of infections dropped. However, just before Christmas a new variant arrived and cases soared again.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of December, storm Bella blew down part of our fence, so we had a new kitchen garden fence put up in January.</p>
                <p>The news in January was dominated by US President Trump refusing to acknowledge that he had lost the election. This resulted in the Capitol Building being stormed by some of his supporters.</p>
                <p>Had the downstairs cloakroom refurbished between February and May, although the handle holes in the shower door were in the wrong place and it was not until July that a new one was fitted.</p>
                <p>We produced a lot of alternative designs for the walled garden, but the only thing that happened was the removal of the old shed. This made the garden look a lot bigger, but I had to install a 'cupboard' in the kitchen garden for, at least, some of the tools.</p>
                <p>The photo above shows the most embarrassing event of the year. We had problems with the MG on the South Downs Run at the begging of September, with the engine stuttering. Eventually we stopped at a service area on the A22 north of Eastbourne and a convenient RAC man had a look at the problem. Unfortunately he caused more problems and the engine would not then start. So we had to be transported back home.</p>
                <p>We took quite a few walks earlier in the year, but they tailed off as we got towards winter.</p>
                <p>Victoria et al moved into a new house in Berkley Heights at the beginning of February. They had remedial work done, like a new (shingle) roof and floor supports strengthened and then had the kitchen refitted, with a little remodelling of the living area. The refitting of two of their bathrooms (they also have one in the basement) started between Christmas and the New Year.</p>
                <p>During the year we both had two Covid-19 vaccinations (starting in February) and a Booster in early December. Needless to say, we were on our own again for Christmas. So Christmas Day was spent on FaceTime calls.</p>
