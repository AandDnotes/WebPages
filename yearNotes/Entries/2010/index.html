            <h1>2010</h1>
            <p>The year may have ended on a chilly note, but the highlight of the year was Paul and Krista’s wedding that took place in November. Luckily it was the one dry day amongst a period of wet weather.</p>
            <p>Another major event was the move by Angela’s aunt from Essex to Steyning. We are her only family, but, at 95. we thought she had left it too late to consider such a move.However, by the middle of September she had sold her house, bought a bungalow in Steyning and moved. We are still helping her unpack boxes!</p>
            <p>Angela’s mother has lived with us for some years (she has a bedroom cum sitting room and a shower room at the end of our bungalow), my parents live about five miles away on the southern side of the Downs and now Angela’s aunt is a ten minute walk away. Plus we have a geriatric dog; Pip is now fifteen and goes for an amble rather than a walk. So going away for holidays is a problem. Thus our trips have been very short in duration this year (again)!</p>
            <p>However, the year should end with a celebration as Angela’s mother reaches 100 years old on New Year’s Eve. Victoria and her husband have now been back in the UK for 20 months now, so we will have a full family gathering on Christmas Day and on New Year’s Eve.</p>
            <p>With only two and a half years before retirement it would be nice to be winding down. However, this year seems to have been busier than ever, with more overseas trips than usual. Although I still enjoy my work, the prospect of retiring is becoming more appealing. I’m looking forward to making more use of my bus pass!</p>
            <p>Do roam around the few pages that we’ve put together and we hope that all our friends have an enjoyable 2011.</p>
