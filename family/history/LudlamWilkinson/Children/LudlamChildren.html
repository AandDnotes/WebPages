                <p>Harry and May had two daughters, Eileen and Vera.</p>
                <p>Rene was Eileen's and Vera's cousin who was 'taken in' by May. Rene was the daughter of 'Uncle Chris', but we don't know if he was May's brother (and therefore a Wilkinson) or Harry's brother (and so a Ludlam). We always knew her as our Aunt.</p>
                <p>Rene married Jack Harris, who was an insurance company branch manager until he had a stroke at quite a young age. Prior to his stroke, Jack liked his beer and was know to drink 12 pint in an evening! Jack and Rene had one son, John. Alan and I always think of John as our cousin.</p>
                <p>Vera (born 11th May 1927, died 9th June 2014) initially married Ron Owen, but divorced him when he left her for another woman and she later married Bill(?) Anderson. However, Ron and Vera had a daughter, Beryl.</p>
                <p>Beryl Owen married Jim Housego and had three children, Michael William Housego (1984), Sarah Ann Housego (1987) and Daniel Mark Housego (1988).</p>
