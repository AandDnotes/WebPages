                <p>Rosina May Ludlam (nee Wilkinson) born 8th March 1899 in Tottenham, died 27th April 1999.</p>
                <p>On her death certificate May was described as a retired milliner and Harry as a retired clerical worker. Until he retired he worked in the stores at the Benjamin Electric of Brantwood Works, Tariff Road, Tottenham, London, N17. However, on Eileen and Jim's marriage certificate, Harry was described as a machinist.</p>
                <p>Harry, a very quiet and softly spoken man, was injured in the First World War, with shrapnel in his neck and leg. He always had circulation problems in his feet and towards the end of his life had his toes amputated. He was quite deaf and used an old-style NHS hearing aid with a single earpiece and the body in his shirt pocket. You would see him on occassions turn it off when he wanted some peace and quiet.</p>
                <p>When Harry died they wer living in a first-floor flat at 28 Grange Road, Tottenham, N17. Later, May moved to a care home in Henley-on-Thames, organised by Vera, who lived nearby.</p>
