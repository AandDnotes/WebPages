                <h1>Jim's Notes on his Family</h1>
                <p>[There was no date on these notes, but they must have been written in the early 2000s.]</p>
                <p>This is about Mum, Dad and family.</p>
                <p>Mum's single name was Travers. Her mother came from a good family and they did not like the idea of her marrying a carpenter and were against it. So after the wedding they disowned her. They had four children. The youngest was about four years old when their mother died. Mum was the oldest so had to look after the other three children, Maud, Rose and Fred. Granddad Travers never married again and kept the family together.</p>
                <p>Mum and Dad were very young when they married. Dad was a pastry cook until he went into the army in 1914 and was in the trenches in France. Dad had four brothers, Harry, Dick, Albert and Jim, and one sister, Lucy.</p>
                <p>Grandma James never got on with Mum, but Granddad got on well with everyone. I was about ten years old when he died. Grandma died a few years after.</p>
                <p>Haggerston Road School was closed in 1930. The Head Teacher gave my Mum a brass pot that she had on her desk. She put &frac14;of tea and 2lb of sugar in the pot. She had taught all of us children and the reason she gave Mum the pot she said was because the children were sent to school clean and were always well behaved. I still have that brass pot and hope one of the boys will take it.</p>
                <p>This is how my family was made up. Bill was the oldest and the brightest. He left school at 14 and started as an apprentice with London Transport; it was then the General Bus Company.He worked at London Fields bus garage all his working life and ended up as manager. Bill was very well spoken and if you wanted to know anything you asked Bill. He went into the RAF as an instructor. He married Ethel, but they had no children.</p>
                <p>Next came the twins, Lucy and Richard (Dick). Lucy was a lovely girl. She only had one job and that was as a librarian at Bishopsgate Institute. She worked from 9am to 6pm so she travelled from Haggerston to Liverpool Street station. Before she went to work she made sure that we had our breakfast and went to school in time. She married Tom, a french polisher, before he went into the RAF. He was sent to the Orkney Islands. Sadly he was killed. He was a great loss to the family. Lucy was depressed for a long time, then she went out with Charles. He played the saxaphone in a small band and was very good. After the war she married Charles. They had one son, Anthony. He married Jill and they have two sons.</p>
                <p>Richard (Dick) was the clown of the family.He left school at 14 and had many jobs, but ended up with London Transport at Dalston Garage, the same garage as Bill. They would not believe that he was Bill's brother. Dick married Flossy [Florence?] and they had one daughter, Eileen. She was named after my Eileen and we were her god parents. She was a lovely girl. Sadly she died very young. One thing I must tell you about Dick is that before he worked at Dalston Garage he worked on the London Underground and just before he was to get marriedhe fell off the platform on to the live rail. He was lucky not to have been killed, but was badly burnt. But by the time he got married his burns had healed and he looked his old self.</p>
                <p>Lily came after the twins. She was so different to Lucy. She had a mind of her own, if she did not want to do something she would not do it, no matter what.When she was about five she was playing with Lucy and they had a fall. Lily punctured her lung and had to have it removed, but recovered from that. When she was about 18 she worked in a factory and started going out with the foreman, his name was Bert Stray. He was a good chap and got on well with the family. One Christmas she told Mum that she was going to have Christmas dinner with Burt's family. Well, when Mum told Dad he said no way was she going anywhere else for dinner but his table. He told Lily, but she insisted she was going to Burt's for dinner. Dad told her that if she went she need not come home. She went to Burt's and she never came home again. They got married and had their first baby. I did see Lily before she had the baby. I was working in Shoreditch and knew she was living nearby. I went and asked in the Post Office and one of the ladies in the queue knew her and gave me the address. I went there in my lunch break and her mother-in-law answered the door. She said Lily would be home for lunch and invited me in for a few minutes. Lily cam in and did not know me at first, but once we got talking she told me how much she missed the family. It was still over a year before she came home. Once she came home to see us she was always welcome home.</p>
                <p>Elsie was good at school. She left school at 14 and worked at making ladies underwear. She had a boyfriend named Eddie and he was a librarian. He joined the RAF and became a fighter pilot and was posted to the Far East. Before he went into the RAF he gave me his bike.He was the only child and sadly got killed in action. Elsie joined the WAAFS [Women's Auxiliary Air Force] and had a few romances. When she came out of the Air Force she had a job to settle down and married Richard. He was my mate in the army and they were pen pals. When he came home from India they got married. They had Martin, but when Martin was about two they parted. She got married a coupel of years later to Charlie. He was a good man and a great dad to Martin. When Charlie died, Elsie spent the rest of her life in kent so she could be near Martin.</p>
                <p>I came next and then Mick. He was a lovely little boy. He was born in St Leonards Hospital in Shoreditch. His real name is Cyril Leonard. How he got the name of Mick was when Mum's sister went to the hospital to see him she said he was like a little mouse and the name stuck. She died a couple of months after. Mick loved dancing. When he was five he could tap dance and swim and no fear of the water or the tap board. He went into the army at about 19 years old and when he came out he married Joan and they had two boys, Gary and David.</p>
                <p>There is one story that I must tell about Dick. Before he went to work one day, Mum had made a bread pudding and asked if he would like to take a bit for his lunch. On the way to work there was an air raid going on and he had to take shelter in a doorway. A bomb fell near him and the blast from the bomb caught his jacket.He was not hurt, but the bread pudding had gone. He started to look for it and an air raid warden asked him what he was looking for. When he told him he said never mind that, get under cover. He never found his bread pudding.</p>
