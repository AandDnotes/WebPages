          <a href="images/IMG_0976.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="photop-right" src="images/IMG_0976.jpg"></a>In June 1951, Percy William Hinxman, Angela’s grandfather, bought a pocket watch from Bravingtons in Pentonville Road, Kings Cross, London. It cost him £25, which, according to the Bank of England, was the equivalent of £667 in November 2024. At the time, Percy and his wife Rose were living at 2 Longfield Avenue, Hackbridge, Walington in Surrey. This is just west of Croydon.</p>
          <p>In 2024 we asked Wheelers in Worthing if they were interested in buying it and also how much it would cost to service it. They said that they would offer us £385 for it in its non-working state and that a service (including changing the front crystal) would cost £395. Since we have all the provenance to go with the watch we decided to have it serviced and keep it in the family.</p>
          <p>The hand-written text on the receipt seems to say ‘Gents solid gold 17 jewel pocket watch’.</p>
