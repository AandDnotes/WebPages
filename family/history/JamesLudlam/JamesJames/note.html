                <h1>Jim's Notes About His Life</h1>
                <p>[There was no date on these notes, but they must have been written in the early 2000s and amounted to 40 pages of hand-written script.]</p>
                <p>I was born on the 19th November 1923 in a small terraced house at 19 Loanda Street, Haggerston, Shorditch. I was born at home and was the sixth child. There was Bill, then the twins, Lucy and Richard,then there was Lilly and Elsie and then me, followed by Mick.</p>
                <p>Mum's sister, Aunty Chris, died and left three girls, Chrissy, Doris and .... So the three girls were taken by different Aunties. Mum took Doris, so she became our sister, that made eight children in all. We all got on very well, apart from a few rows between Mum and Dad.</p>
                <p>At the age of five I went to Haggereston Road School and stayed there until I was seven.Then I went to Laburnam Street, stayed there until I was 11 and then went to Schoalfel Road until I was 14 and then went to work. When I first started school two other boys living in my street started at the same time. They were Alfie (Porky) Davis and Dave Bevens. We were mates up to our teens and were always together. At the bottom of our street was the Regent canal. We were told many times to keep away from the canal.</p>
                <p>Having a younger brother sometimes is a bit of a bind, but you would not be without him and would not let any harm come to him. Most times I would be out with Porky and Dave, but Mum often told me to look after him. Holidays, when we werre off school,I had to look after Micky. I was given a shilling for some sandwiches and a bottle of drink and we went out for most of the day. We had a sixpenny all day tram ticket that took us all over London. You could go anywhere the trams went.</p>
                <p>We would get on the tram at Kingsland Road, Shorditch, go through the Kingsway Subway (long since closed) and go along the Embankment and see Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. So Mick had seen a great deal of London at a very young age. Most bank holidays were spent on the trams. One stands out in my mind. We had decided to go to Epping Forest for the day, just Porky, Dave and myself, and take our sandwiches to eat. Mum asked me to take Mick along. It was a nice day and we decided to light a fire and heat up some water in a tin and put an Oxo cube in it for a drink. We left to get the tram home as you could not use the tram ticket after 6pm. We were home when my brother Bill came in and told us about a forest fire in Epping, so we missed all the excitement. We did not go to Epping Forest for a long time after that as I'm sure it had something to do with us.</p>
                <p>One Saturday we were down the cut (that's what we called the canal). My brother Dick and his mates were down there fishing and one of them caught a leg of pork.Someone had thrown it in, but after cleaning it up they decided to hang it inside one of their mates door. It was easy to open any door as we all had a string that you pulled to open the door. Later in the week Dick's mate told how someone had left some meat behind the front door and they had it for Sunday lunch and some over for in the week. So it was not past its sell by date.</p>
                <p>We always looked forward to the weekend. Ridley Road market in Dalston was a must in the summer. The market closed at 6pm, so there were plenty of orange and apple boxes.We collected as many as we could get on our home-made barrow. The boxes were for heating up the copper that was for filling up the tin bath on Saturday in front of the fire.. One bath would do for two of us. The lucky one got in first.As we got older we went to the public baths. That cost us two old pennies, with a towel. If you wanted more hot or cold water you shouted out 'more hot for number 5'. Often someone would call out cold for a number other than their own, so often you got cold water you did not want.</p>
                <p>Going back to the market. On Friday nights Sir Oswald Mosley was there. He was the leader of the Blackshirt movement. He and his party were, I think, against the Jews and all immigrants. You could guarantee there would be a punch-up in the crowd.</p>
                <p>There were several ways to make a bit of pocket money. We would sell firewood at 1d [old penny] a bag and collect lamb cloths that were used to cover the carcasses of the lambs. We would wash them in the canal and sell them as dish cloths. Then there was the fire lighting job. Dalston had a large Jewish population. So on Jewish holidays we would go round and light their fires for them, as they were not allowed to do anything on that day. You could make at least half a crown [2 shillings and 6 pence] that day. Then I had a paper round. I would deliver the morning paper and on Sundays I would have to collect the week's money. For this I got 2/6 [2 shillings and 6 pence]. I gave this to Mum and I kept 6 pence.</p>
                <p>Before dinner on Sunday I would go to Hackney Road, where my Gran lived (my Dad's Mum). My Mum would give me a shilling to give her. Some times, if I had any money, I would put sixpence to it and give her one and six. That was my good deed for the week.</p>
                <p>One of the first things my Dad taught us was to swim.We went to Haggerston baths and Porky always came with us. Once we could swim we used to go down the canal. After a time we were swimming in it and jumping on the barges. Most barges were full of coal, wood, cement and most things that now go by road. Often when we were swimming, the canal police would come along the towpath, so we would grab our clothes and swim to the other side. If Mum and Dad found out about us in the canal we got a good telling off. There you are, boys will be boys.</p>
                <p>There was a family that lived near us by the name of Baylis. They had two children, Maude and Harry. The girl was the oldest and Harry was always called 'Harry Boy', but we never used the first part, so he was always called 'Boy', even by his mum and dad. They had their Nan living with them. They were a little more posh than the rest of the families living in our street.My Mum got talking to them one day and they asked if I would go and play with Boy. That is how we became friends.They were living near us for about two years and I got on very well with the family.They moved to Highams Park, this was about half an hour from us and I used to go and stay with them some weekends. When I was about ten years old my Mum was taken very ill. I did not know how ill she was. One weekend I was going to stay with the Baylis's at Highams Park. Before I left, Lucy, my sister, gave me a letter to give to Mrs Baylis. I did not know what was in the letter at the time, but was told later that they were asked to take me in if anything happened to my Mum. They sent a letter back saying that they would and that they would treat me as one of their own. A week passed and Mum started to get better, so everything was OK. Mum thanked Mr &amp; Mrs Baylis for their kindness. They were such a lovely family I will never forget them.</p>
                <p>I loved to help my Dad when he had some decorating. He would send me to the builder's yard for what he wanted. One time I had to get two bushels of hair and lime. This was to plaster the wall in one of the bedrooms. I had to ask the man to put in plenty of hair so it would bind well.</p>
                <p>I had my own shed in the garden. I kept all sort of junk in there. I had about 20 tame mice in there, so my sisters would never go in there.One day I bought a grass snake from the pet shop for sixpence. When I got home with the snake the girls went mad. They offered me a shilling to get rid of it. I went outside, put the snake in the shed and then told them I had put it down the toilet. They went spare. After a while I told them I had it in the shed. I had to show them, but to please them I took it back to the shop.</p>
                <p>There was always something going on in our street.We had a bookmaker that used to stand in the passage of the house next door taking bets. It was illegal to take bets when I was a boy. The bookie would stand in the passage and collect bets from the locals. He would have two lookouts, one at either end of the street, looking out for the police. If they spotted a policeman they gave him a warning and he would then run through the house into the garden, then over the wall into next door. I used to take a bet in for my Mum &amp; Dad. They would have sixpence each way on a horse and they never put their name on the bet, so they used Lucky Jim. Whether or not it was very lucky I don't know.</p>
                <p>My Mum used to work very hard. She worked as a cleaner at the Bishops Gate Library. She started at 7am till 10am, then she went back in the evening from 6 to 8pm. My sister Lucy worked in the same place as a librarian.  Dad was a bus driver. He worked from Hackney bus garage and drove a no.6 bus.</p>
                <p>One day my Mum asked me to go and pay the hire purchase money at the place they had bought furniture and had to pay so much a week. The shop was in Mead Street, Hackney and was a bus ride away. She gave me 2d, that was a penny each way on the bus. My mate Porky was with me so she gave him his bus fare, so he could go with me. We decided to walk and spend the fare. We started walking, but when we got to the main road we decided to get a ride on the back of a lorry. The speed of lorries then was only about 25 mph. Most lorries had a tail board and the spare wheel was under the tail board. All you had to do was hang on to the tail board and keep your feet on the spare wheel. We were hanging on this lorry going along Hackney Road and I looked behind me. There was a no.6 bus and the driver was my Dad. What a shock; as soon as the lorry slowed down we got off. My Dad shouted out "I will see you tomorrow". We paid the H.P. money and walked home. Next day I tried to avoid my Dad. When I did see him I got a good telling off and a warning what would happen if I ever did this again. On that same week we were told at school that one of the boys had been killed when the tail board of the lorry he was riding on came unhooked and he was crushed under the tail board. I used to go on a lorry after that, but it was to help my Uncle. He used to deliver good and I used to be his van boy and sort the packages out ready for delivery. I loved this as I was sorting while he was driving along and this was in an open back lorry.</p>
                <p>Another job I had while at school was to help the R. White Lemonade man. THis was on a horse and cart. We used to deliver to the shops on a Saturday. One Saturday, the day my brother Bill was getting married,I fell off the cart and knocked myself out, but after half an hour I was OK. This was the second time I had been knocked out while helping someone. The other time was when I was helping the green grocer on the corner of our street. He asked me to take four sacks of potatoes to a fish shop in Hoxton market. Eacj sack weighed one hundredweight, so there was four hundredweight on a market barrow.I had the barrow well balanced. When I got near Hoxton it was down hill and the road was all cobbled. I balanced myself on the barrow and was riding it down the hill when the front legs of the barrow hit the cobbles. It stopped dead and the cross bar that I was balanced on hit me in the stomach and I was out like a light. I came too in St Leanards Hospital. How I got there I don't know. Someone took the spuds to the fish shop and I lost the job. I was about thirteen then and just after that I moved to Philip Lane in Tottenham.</p>
                <p>As I only had about ten months left to go to school, I stayed at my old school in Hackney. I used to go by trolley busses, that had replaced the trams. I used to take sandwiches, as in those days there was no such thing as school dinners. The headmaster let me make a cup of Oxo for myself and one for him. I left at 14 and Dad got me a job at the Evening Standard newspaper, off Farringdon Street, Holborn, London. The job was to change the plackards on the side of the vans. Every time the van left it had to have the latest headlines on the side of the van. You did not have to use your brains to do this job. There were three boys doing this job and you had to change the plackards about six times a day. We used to take some stick from the men. One day I was locked in a van and driven all over London and when I got back the manager told me off. I used to go to the print room and have my sandwiches, sitting on a huge roll of paper, watching the papers being printed. One day, sitting there, two of the men held me over the roll of paper, pulled up my shirt and covered me with ink and paste. I went into the toilet to clean myself up and the manager came in and told me to take the rest of the day off. Next to the works they were building a new factory for the Evening Standard. One lunch time we went to watch them working on the foundations. We found a dead rat, so this was a chance to get our own back. One of the men that covered me in glue used to take home paper so his wife would wrap his lunch in it. So we took the rat to the changing room where he kept his case and put the rat in the paper that was in the case. Next day he came in and was looking for us. He told the manager that the rat fell out of the case when his wife opened it and she got a bit of a shock. The manager said to him that perhaps the silly pranks will stop and they did. </p>
                <p>I told Mum that I did not like the job, so she got me a job at W.H.Smiths at Liverpool Street Station. I was in charge of a book stall on Aldgate East Station. I liked the job because you felt like you were your own boss. I used to travel from Liverpool Street underground to Aldgate East, so I used to pick up any books that were left on the train. If they were not out of date I would put them in the returns so they would make up for the books that were taken off the stall and not paid for (in other words, books that were nicked).</p>
                <p>I had a couple of years there and then had a job with my uncle at a glass blowers in Dalston. We made wine bottles. I worked with the blowers as the blew the bottles and the necks were shaped. I had to take the bottles and put them in a machine called a lear. It was white hot where you put the bottles and they travelled through and gradually got colder. I was not there very long, it was too hot and there were not many prospects there. I got a job on the London Northeastern Railway at Tottenham Hale Station. They wanted me to train as a signalman, but the war broke out and everything changed.</p>
                <p>I became an A.R.P. [Air Raid Precautions] Messenger. What I had to do was to take messages from one A.R.P. post to another when the telephone lines were down. At the start of the war things were very quiet, so they dispensed with the Messengers. So I had to find another job.</p>
                <p>The next job was as an approved A.I.D. Inspector. This was at Benjamin Electric in Edmonton. I had never worked with women before. I will never forget the day I walked into that factory. There were about 15 benches and each bench had three or four girls working at them. They all looked up and I went as red as a beetroot. The job I had to do was to inspect their work. When I passed it, 5% was then inspected by the Aeronautical Inspection Department. We were making parts for aircraft, such as landing lights and cockpit lights. The list was endless.</p>
                <p>I was given a weeks training and then let loose on the floor. I had to inspect the girls work. If I rejected any work, the girls had to put it right. There was one girl whose work I used to inspect and she never got any rejects; if there were I used to put them right. I used to help some of the girls by putting some of their work right so that they could not say that I was helping one girl and not them. There were three men in our department and we were all called Jim, so they asked me to use my second name, so I was called Eddy.</p>
                <p>I used to tell my Mum about a girl that I liked at work and she used to say why don't you ask her out, but I just could not pluck up enough courage to ask her out. One weekend we found out that the girls were going to the Wood Green Empire on Saturday night, so us boys decided to do the same, but we did not tell the girls. There were four of us, so we hired a box at the theatre. After the show we asked the girls to meet us in the Alexander pub and that is where I asked Eileen to come out with me. That same night Jimmy Greenhill and myself went home with Eileen and Rene and there was a party going on and that was the start of our going out together.</p>
                <p>After a while Eileen was asked to take an office job. She was not very keen, but went over to No. 2 factory in the office. She stayed a couple of weeks and then asked to go back to the assembly shop. I was glad to see her back. After a while we got engaged and then I got my call-up papers. I could have gone and worked down the coal mines or the forces. I was hoping to go into the RAF, but I was sent to Gravesend in Kent. Before I went my Dad showed me how to make up an Army bed and how to keep out of trouble.</p>
                <p>I arrived at Ellis barracks at Gravesend [this seems to be the name of the barracks at Farnborough]. I was one of many. We were given our uniforms. That was one of the worst days of my life. The next day we were given talks about the Army. That night I went home; well, not to my home, but to see Eileen. I was only there for one hour and had to travel back. We were told not to go outside Gravesend, but I took a chance and was back in camp by lights out at 11pm.</p>
                <p>I spent six weeks training. The thing I did not like was bayonet practice; learning how to kill was not very nice. After six weeks I was sent to Farnborough, Hants, to join the Royal Armoured Corps. We were smartened up a bit by having our uniforms made to fit better. We were told how good the Tank Regiment was and we were expected to keep the good name up.</p>
                <p>Over the weeks we trained in different skills. Before I left Gravesend I got seven days leave and spent most of the time with Eileen. We made plans to get married. I had to ask Eileen's Dad for permission to marry her. He was a lovely man and looked on me as a Son. He said yes and he would be very happy to have me as a son-in-law. Then I had to ask my parents. My Dad said if you are old enough to fight in a war you are old enough to know if you want to get married. Then I had to get permission from my Commanding Officer. Once I did that I had to get leave.</p>
                <p>I got seven days leave and the wedding day was Saturday 6th February 1943. I arrived home on the Friday night and was told that Mum and Dad were not speaking.This did upset me and they could see it and told me everything would be OK tomorrow.</p>
                <p>My brother Dick was my best man. On Saturday we made our way to St James's Church in Fore Street, Edmonton, but on the way we called into the car hire office on the High Cross. The reason for calling there was to make sure that the cars had been booked, as Dad had promised to pay for the cars. I was really relieved when the girl in the office told us everything was OK. What a relief.</p>
                <p>We got the bus to the church. There were crowds outside. We had a wonderful wedding. Eileens Mum and Dad did everything for us and all our friends helped to make our day. We had no honeymoon; our only treat was to go to the London Palladium and saw 'Best Bib and Tucker' with Tommy Trinder. I went back to camp a week later. It was the hardest thing I had to do to leave Eileen. After a few weeks Eileen came down to Farnborough for the weekend. I was able to book bed and breakfast. I used to get a sleeping out pass. WE stayed at the same house every time; one Saturday night she even came up and tucked us in. I was sent home on embarkation leave. We made the most of the time we had together as we did not know when we would be seeing each other again.</p>
                <p>I left Farnborough on a Friday. We were given tropical kit, so we were off to the tropics somewhere. We boarded the boat; I think it was Greenock in Scotland as most of the docks in the south were being bombed. As we were boarding the ship we were given a card showing where you had to go on the ship. My card told me I was on G deck, which was the lowest deck on the ship. The name of the ship was the Strathard. We had the choice of hammock or matress; I had a hammock. We sailed at night and we were the first convoy to sail through the Suez Canal. There were about 15 ships in the convoy. Once we got into the Red Sea we did not get much sleep at night as our escort, which consisted of three destroyers, were dropping depth charges most nights. We were told later that we were being shadowed by U-boats. The Bay of Biscay was a nightmare. I have never seen so many men being sick. We made it OK to Bombay, where we disembarked and got a train to Poona.</p>
                <p>The barracks outside Poona was a bit grotty. Training started straight away. I was a Gunner. The tank crew consisted of Driver, Gunner, Wireless Operator and Tank Commander. Inside the tank you stored ammo, such as shells and bullets, but we always left a space for packets of tea, coffee and packets of food and water. This we all chipped in for; every tank crew did this.</p>
                <p>One day we were called in for a medical as we were about to leave Poona. When I went in for my examination the M.O. told me I had a rupture and ordered me to hospital that day. I went into Poona army hospital and had further examinations and was told I would be operated on the next morning. I was got ready for the operation and the surgeon was Lt Cornish. He was a big man, about 6'6" and a gentleman. After the operation I was told that I was very near a strangulated hernia. I was in hospital for six weeks. I wrote a letter home every day, but Eileen used to receive them several at a time, so one of the first letters she got from me was to say I was in hospital.</p>
                <p>I went back to my unit, but most of them had gone and I was replaced by somebody else. The next I heard was that they were in Burma. I was on light duties for some time and it looked as if I was to stay in Poona for some time.  One day I was put on anti-maleria duty. What you had to do was drive around where there was stagnant water and spray oil on the water, to kill the lavae of the mosquitos. One day I did not feel too good and went to bed early. In the night I was taken into hospital with maleria.</p>
                <p>I was taken in hospital with malaria. At one time they gave you quinine to get you over it, but that was no longer available. So you had to take two tablets, one of moperquine [?] and one of plasmoquine. I had a bad reaction to the treatment that I was given, so I was in hospital longer than most.</p>
                <p>It was about six months after leaving hospital that I got maleria again. I was back again for quite a while and did not go back to my unit. I was wait listed, which meant that I would go to a holding unit until they found a place for me. I was sent to the Dulaly holding unit in Southern India. I arrived there on my 21st birthday. There were two other men. It was raining hard when we got to the camp and we were given a four-man tent and were told to put it up and dig a trench around the tent to keep the water out. What a birthday. One I will not forget in a hurry. I was there for only one week and was transferred to the Indian Army Ordnance at Whitefield, Bangalor.</p>
                <p>The Ordnance Depot waas out in the wilds and covered a vast area and had a couple of villages nearby. That is where most of the labourers came from. When I arrived there I had to report to Sergeant Major Carrie. He was the senior NCO. He told me to help myself to a drink and wanted to know all about me and why I had left my old unit. The camp was under canvas. The tent I had I shared with Ray Williams. He was known as Curly. We became good mates.</p>
                <p>I worked in the depot and my C.O. was Major Pearce. He was married and lived in Bangalore with his wife. They were in their sixties. The second in command was Captain Keegan. He had escaped from the Japanese in Burma.</p>
                <p>I was put in charge of returned stores and depot transport. I had about 30 labourers working for me. I had a bearer; his name was Monicam. He used to make my bed, take my clothes to be washed every day and bring me a cup of tea every morning. I paid him 10 Rupees a week. That was about 15 shillings, but I always gave him more and gave him things to take home. He had a wife and a baby girl. I could trust him with anything. He used to work for others as well.</p>
                <p>One morning I overslept and was late for work. Monicam had not turned up. When I got back at night he was in my tent and he started apologising and told me it would not happen again. I told him off and not to let it happen again. Next day one of the other bearers told me that Monicam's baby had died in the night. Well I wished the ground had opened and I had fallen in. I sent for Monicam right away. He came to my tent. I told him to sit on my bed and asked him why he did not tell me what had happened. All he said was that he did not want to worry me. I gave him 100 Rupees (about £7) and told him not to come back for a week. He just said thank you Master. When he came back, Curly had a whip round for him and gave him another £10, which was a lot of money in those days.</p>
                <p>A few weeks after this Major Pearce sent for me. He said he wanted someone to go to Mysore to work on an Army contract. He gave me a couple of days to think about it. I thought this was a good opportunity for me, so I accepted the offer. I had to report to HQ in Bangalore. There I met the officer I was going with. He was Lt Brignall. There was another Sgt as well. He was Sgt Gibbs.</p>
                <p>I had to drive to Mysore. Part of my job was to drive and look after the 15 cwt truck. Sgt Gibbs and myself stayed at the Ritz Hotel and Lt Brignall stayed at a bigger hotel nearby. We met the contractors next day. The main contractor was Boris Basarver and his brother-in-law , Mr Shereff. He owned the saw mill. Our job was to supervise the removal of timber from the forest, taken to the saw mill to be sawn into planks and then made into engine boxes for Ford and Chevy engines. There were so many new engines in India and very few in England after Dunkirk, so they had to be sent back to England.</p>
                <p>The forest commissioner was a Scot and he had a bungalow on the edge of the forest and he was responsible for everything that went on in the Wynard jungle [<a href="http://www.wayanad.com">Wayanad</a>]. We were often called in to sort out problems and he was very strict about how the elephants worked.</p>
                <p>While I was staying at the Ritz, the local vicar came to see me and introduced himself at the Rev Keys and talked me into going to church the next Sunday. I got on well with him and his wife and was often invited to their house.</p>
                <p>After a couple of months at the Ritz, Lt Brignall came up with the idea of renting a house together. So we started looking for a house. After a week we found a three bed house with a cook and a hire (cleaner). The cash the Army gave the three of us we pooled and paid the rent for the house. It was better than living in the hotel, but Brignall and Gibbs were always arguing.</p>
                <p>We made friends with the owner of the Mysore Silk Mill. We were shown around the mill and saw how they got the silk from the cocoon. They put the cocoon in a barrel of water. They then found the end of the silk and it was wound off on to a bobbin. They had big sheds with thousands of silk moths. They even grew the mulberries that they fed the moths on. After the visit to the silk mill, the manager invited us back to his house for a meal. After the meal he told us that he was the only person in Mysore that was allowed to shoot an elephant. He had permission from the Maharaja of Mysore to shoot any rogue elephants. A rogue elephant is one that goes mad and is very dangerous and has to be put down. He asked if we would like to go on a tiger shoot. We said yes, but I was not very keen.</p>
                <p>About a week afterwards we went on a shoot. The thing was, it was at night. I drove us; we went in the Army 15cwt. It was just getting dark when we arrived. We each had a 12-bore rifle. We spent about an hour looking around, but did not spot any game. We went back to the truck and had a picnic of sorts. After we had eaten I took the empty tiffin tins back to the truck. As I got to the road I saw something big running down the road towards the truck. I dropped the tins and jumped into the back of the truck. I fired one shot and missed. It passed the truck and ran into the trees. It was a boar. Then I heard a couple of shots. The others saw it and they missed. I was very glad when we left and went home, but it was an experience. Even when we were having our meal, sitting in the dark, you could hear lots of animal noises, so there were plenty about.</p>
                <p>About a week after the night in the jungle I saw the Reverend Keys and he invited me to tea on the Sunday. I went on the Sunday and they had another guest and I was introduced to her. She was a Deaconess from London on a visit to India. She told me how lucky I was to be in India and what a wonderful experience. I said that I could not agree with her and I told her why. I have not seen my wife for two and a half years. I had not been married long before I was sent out to India and the sooner I saw the back of India the better. She was out there by choice, but I had no choice.</p>
                <p>The next day I had to take a convoy of lorries, loaded with engine cases, to Bangalore, about four hours drive. On the way one of the trucks had an accident. It ran off the road and one of the Indian drivers was killed.WE had to put him in the back of one of the trucks and when we got to Bangalore I had to find a doctor to confirm he was dead. Sounds daft, but that was the law. They had an enquiry and it was put down as accidental death.</p>
                <p>When the job came to the end, one of the contractors asked me if I would like a job when I came out of the Army. He made me a very good offer. I wrote home and told Eileen about it, but she did not want to live in India.</p>
                <p>I left Mysore and went back to Bangalore. I had got used to living in a house in Mysore, so it was hard going back to living in a tent. My mates were glad to see me back. Monicam, my old bearer, was over the moon to see me back. I wa back in my old job again, except that I was given and extra job as dog disposer. There were packs of half wild dogs that came into the depot and most of them suffered from mange and distemper. I was issued with a 12 bore and a 2.2 rifle. I would take two labourers and a bullock cart and once a week would tour the camp looking for dogs. One day we had disposed of several dogs and on the way back I spotted two dogs in the waste pit, quite a way from us. I used the 2.2, but only got one. Unfortunately that dog belonged to a Major from the ammunition depot. I was not to blame because everyone was told to keep pet dogs in. When we were carrying out this exercise I reported this to my C.O. and he informed the owner. This was not a very nice job, but it had to be done.</p>
                <p>I had been in India about two years when they used the atom bomb on Japan. Not long after that the war with Japan was over and we were all given a bottle of Indain beer. It was like drinking vinegar. Naturally we all thought we would be going home, but not so. When I was called up in 1941 I was called up for the duration of war, but they changed it to duration of hostilities. So we never knew when we would be sent home.</p>
                <p>Some time after the war was over with Japam they started a leave scheme. As I hadn't taken any leave for over two years I was given the chance of leave. I was only given two days notice to get packed and get to Madras to catch a plane. This scheme was put together very quickly; the planes they used were bombers. The one I got on was a Liberator. They put in some wooden forms and some seat belts and portable toilets. There were about 20 of us in the plane. The first stop was Calcutta, where we changed planes and got into a Dekota. Most of the planes were falling apart. Next stop was Karachi. We changed planes again; this time it was a Lancaster. They called it a flying coffin, as it looked like a coffin with wings, but it got us to Cairo West in Egypt. We had a few days in Cairo, so we had chance to do a bit of sight seeing. We toured the pyramids and sphinx. When we were there an American soldier fell off the pyramid and was killed. Next we landed in Libya, only to refuel,then home. England looked to green and lovely from the air. WE landed at Merryfield, Taunton in Somerset.</p>
                <p>I had no time to let Eileen know I would be home that day, so to say it was a surprise for her was an understatement. I knocked on the door at Alpha Road, Edmonton at about 10pm and Eileen's Dad opened the door. He stood there with mouth open. Eileen's Mum came out and shouted "It's Jim, it's Jim". Eileen had gone to bed as she had been to the dentist, so she and Rene went to bed at 9:30. It was the first time we had seen each other for two and a half years and this was the first night of my four weeks leave.</p>
                <p>Eileen had a flat in Alpha Road, opposite her Mum's house. It was the ground floor of a terraced house. She had to get coupons to by utility furniture. She was not able to buy a dressing table as you could only get essential furniture. The owner of the house lived upstairs and she got on well with Eileen until I came home, but Eileen did not stay there very long.</p>
                <p>At the end of my four weeks leave I had to report back to Cadogan Place, London. It was a big house and I stayed there over night. The next day you went on parade and you were told if you were flying out that day. If you were not you could go home for the day. I did this for about a week, so if I did not get home by about 12am Eileen would know that I was on my way back to India. I got the train to Merryfield. I was put in charge of a group of young lads that were going out to India for the first time. They had no officer or N.C.O. with them; that is why I was put in charge of them. We got on the plane and were getting settled when I was called to the door and was told to get off the plane as an officer had turned up and was taking over. So I went back to the departure hut.</p>
                <p>I saw the plane take off and saw it crash into the hills. Everyone was killed. It was something you could never forget. The thing was I had phoned my Mum and told her I was leaving that day. I could not let Eileen know as she was not on the phone. I tried to ring home, but all phones were out of order. I was on the next plane out. I did not know at the time, but my Mum phoned the War Office and they went through the names and was told I was not on that plane and she let Eileen know that I was OK and on my way back to India. It was a couple of weeks before Eileen got all the facts from me by letter.</p>
                <p>When I got back, Curly, my mate, told me that my dog had been killed by a snake. She was a lovely old dog, but she had a habit of stealing packs of cigarets from the canteen. She would go behind the counter and pick up a pack of cigarets and take them back to my tent. I had given up smoking so I used to take them back to the canteen. She was called Trixei and was a springer spaniel. I never had another dog after Trixei.</p>
                <p>I was back to work and wishing the time away.I had no idea when I would be going home again. We had a new W.O. posted to us. His name was Bill Burk. He was married and his wife was in India. After about a month he found a bungalow in Whitefield village. Most of the people living in the village were either English or Anglo Indian. Bill's wife was very nice and she had relations in Bangalore and his wife made Eileen a leather bag and me a writing case, but got it wrong. I still have that case today. Bill Burke told me his wife was expecting a baby. Bill was senior Warrant Officer, so he was in charge of everything in the camp, even though he lived out.</p>
                <p>Time went by and Bill's wife had a little boy. They invited me to tea one Sunday and after tea Bill and his wife said they had something to ask me and they said would I like to be God Father to their baby. I told them that I would be pleased to be his God Father and he was Christened James William Burk. From then he was called Jimmy.</p>
                <p>Each week I had so much deducted from my pay and put into a savings scheme, but something went wrong and the savings went missing. It was time for me to leave India, but I was told I would be needed as a witness in a fraud case involving my savings. I had been saving for over a year and the idea of saving was so I had a few pounds when I got out of the Army. The case went on for months and all the time I was fighting to get home. My brother Bill was writing to everyone of importance, like the War Office and the local MP and I was doing the same. Eventually I was told that I would not be needed as a witness and could be repatriated to the UK.</p>
                <p>A few weeks after I was on the Arundel Castle. They used to say the best view of the Gateway of India was from the arse end of a boat and that is what I saw and that was the view I had been waiting to see for over three years.</p>
                <p>The Arundel Castle was a good ship and I shared a cabin with two other Sgt<sup>s</sup>. We were all given jobs to do. I was put in charge of the butcher fatigue. I had to pick out four men from about twenty. When I asked them their names one of them was named Vigers and as soon as he told me his name I new him. He was in my class at school and he remembered me. We had lots to talk about and he stayed with me until we reached England.</p>
                <p>I think we landed in England on the 28th of March 1947 at Southampton. I sent a telegram to Eileen and we met at Waterloo Station. I was there before her. She arrived with my Mum and Dad. After my leave I was demobed. I was given a suite, etc. and was given £60 for the time I spent in the Army, £15 for every year I was away from home.</p>
                <p>I went back to Benjamin Electric, but it was hard to work in a factory. So I left and worked for Bricklands the butchers as a driver. Eileen's Mum was a cashier, as was Eileen's sister, Vera. Eileen became pregnant. I used to deliver to all the shops. One day I went to start the van with the starting handle and it came off and hit me in the face. It happened outside Middlesex Hospital. I had to have my face stitched. I asked the nurse not to put too much dressing on my face as my wife was pregnant and I did not want to shock her too much. Not long after that David was born. We were living with Eileen's Mum at the time. Later we moved into a flat. We had our ups and downs until we got our own place in Cheshunt. David was at school and then Eileen was pregnant. We had a nice maisonette and we were sure life would be much better when this baby was born than what it was when we had David. We had been pushed from pillar to post.</p>
                <p>Alan was born in Hertford Hospital and when Eileen came home with the new baby we were a complete family. We were so proud of our boys and we did the best we could for them and we always got good reports from school.</p>
                <p>We moved from Cheshunt to Potters Bar [actually we moved to a flat in Edmonton before moving to Potters Bar]. The schools were good and they did very well.David went to Lancaster University. Alan was pleased for David, but was very upset as they were at the age when they had things in common. When we went to see David off at the station Alan was very upset. We told him that David would often be home. His answer was that David would never live at home again and he was right.</p>
                <p>I was working for Den Welch and drove all over the country collecting tyres. Then he opened a tyre shop in Tottenham. It was a small shop and out of the way. Before Den took over the business I worked for his father, Tom Welch. He was a big man and he loved food. Before we started work we always had a full breakfast in the cafe and then we went round the country buying second hand tyres and then sell them to the remould factory. He used to send home fruit and meat to Eileen every week and when we used to go to Newmarket he would buy 15 lbs of sausages. He would give me 5 lbs to take home and the rest he gave to Alice. She had the cafe in Alpha Road, Edmonton and that was where we used to have our breakfast. Although he used to give her the sausages he still paid full price for our breakfast.</p>
                <p>Before I worked for Tom I was working for W. Lawrence. Eileen's uncle got me the job. I did all sorts of jobs, even a scaffolder, but I ended up with a mobile compressor and used to travel all over London and the home counties. When a site needed a compressor I was sent to do the job.</p>
                <p>I worked for Den Welch for 12 years. As I mentioned before we were not very busy. He never had much Idea of running a business. One day he told me that things were bad and that I would have to be made redundant. I was given a month's notice and redundancy money. I had never been out of work, so the first thing to do was to go to the labour exchange and put my name down for a job. They offered me a job in the tyre trade, but I'd had enough of the tyre trade. I was told the Post Office wanted postmen.</p>
                <p>I went to Barnet main sorting office and had to go and have a test. I started a week after the test. [Post Office 19th October 1970 to 12th February 1972] I had a week's training and had to get on with it. The trouble was you had a different walk every week. That made it very hard. If you had one round that would have been easy. I have never been so tired in all my life and when we were in company, Eileen would have to keep nudging me as I would have easily dropped off. One day at work they told me that one of the top boys was about to visit the office. When he arrived it was Charles, Christine's Dad. He walked around the sorting office talking to the postmen. He gave a little grin when he shook my hand. I never let on that I knew him.</p>
                <p>I was never keen on the job. You had to do overtime if you liked it or not. So I got a transfer from the Post Office to the Royal Ordnance Small Arms at Enfield. [Royal Ordnance 14th February 1972 to 19th February 1988] At that time the Post Office was still under the government. I got on well at the Small Arms and after about a year I was put on the bench. Working at the Small Arms was not easy at first as everything you did was piece work, so every job had a time and a price. Some jobs were good, others were not so good. After a few years there my job was putting bad work right and any new job that came in myself and my mate Ted Hutchings had to work on it and get it timed. We had lots of tricks up our sleeves when the rate-fixer came to time a job so we always got a good price. When we started the S.A.80 Ted and I were given the job to do all the hand work, so we were not on piece work any more and were paid our average wage, which was about one hundred pounds a week. When they started to design the SA80 I was on the team for about 8 years.</p>
                <p>We had a shock when we were told that the factory was to be sold. It changed hands a couple of times. Aerospace had it, then sold it to Rover and they closed it down all together. We still had the same staff and the same director. His name was Bill Turner. He was a good boss and insisted on a fair day's work and you got a fair day's pay. He often had a chat with me and one day he asked me what I will do when the place closes. I told him that I will be retiring by then and hoped to move to Lymm in Cheshire. I still had nine months before I would be 65. He told me that if I would like to go now he would give me nine month's pay in lieu of notice. So I accepted it and left before they closed down.</p>
