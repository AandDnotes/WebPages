                <p><img id="photo" src="images/EileenJames.jpg" style="float: left; width: 100px; margin: 0px 20px 20px 0px;">Born 30th April 1921 in Edmonton, North London.</p>
                <p>Married to Jim on Saturday 6th February 1943 at St James's Church in Fore Street, Edmonton</p>
                <p><img id="photo" src="images/MayAndEileen.jpeg" style="float: right; width: 300px; margin: 0px 20px 20px 20px;">Here we see Eileen at the age of, probably, three or four, with her mother, May.</p>
                <p>The next is, we believe, a year after her marriage to Jim, obviously taken at a photographic studio.</p>
                <img id="photo" src="images/Eileen1944.jpeg" style="float: left; width: 250px; margin: 0px 20px 20px 0px;">
                <img id="photo" src="images/Alice&JimWilkinson.jpeg" style="float: left; width: 250px; margin: 0px 0px 20px 0px;">
            </div>
            <div id="content" style="clear: both; height: 1050px;">
                <p>The middle photo is of Alice and Jim Wilkinson, Eileen's grandparents, May's parents.</p>
                <p><img id="photo" src="images/Eileen1940Perhaps.jpg" style="float: left; width: 250px; margin: 0px 20px 20px 0px;">This is another photo of Eileen taken in a studio. From her hair style I guess it is when she was about 19.</p>
                <p>Eileen's mother did not want her to go to a state school because she thought that they were 'too rough', so sent her to a private school. Eileen would say that she did more housework than learning, although she did win a prize for French! The photo below shows Eileen at school. She is three rows up and the fourth child from the left. It could be Vera, her sister, in the middle of the second row from the bottom.</p>
                <img id="photo" src="images/EileenSchool.jpg" style="float: left; width: 100%; margin: 0px 0px 20px 0px;">
                <p>Eileen had various jobs. She was assembling aircraft landing lights and other equipment at Benjamins in Edmonton, North London when she met Jim. In Potters Bar she did home work (mainly machining), worked for Revels, the plastic model kit supplier, and worked for a company making mouth pieces for saxaphones.</p>
