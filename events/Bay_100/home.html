                <p>Angela's Mother reached the age of 100 and on June 10th 2015 her younger sister did the same. She is still living on her own, with support from various paid and unpaid people and is still very alert, if a little forgetful. On her birthday some friends from Leigh-on-Sea visited and brought the banners and baloons. She did, of course, receive a card from the queen.</p>
