                  <p class="Title"><br /></p>
                  <div class="paragraph Title"><div style="height: 225px; width: 300px;  clear: right; float: right; height: 225px; margin: 12px 0px 12px 12px; position: relative; width: 300px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_1 inline-block shadow_0"><img src="100th_Birthday_files/IMGP1526.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 225px; width: 300px; " /></div>Actually this New Year's Eve was something of a special occasion. Angela's mother was born on December 31st 1910 and so was 100 years old on New Year's Eve. Celebrations, however, were not quite as originally planned. Victoria and Paul and their spouses, my parents and Angela's aunt all came to lunch, but the guest of honour was missing! Prior to Christmas Angela's mother succumbed to a chest infection that did not respond to antibiotics, so she was taken into hospital and was still there on her birthday.<br /></div>
                  <p class="Title"><br /></p>
                  <p class="Title">The ward sister let us use the day-room and so we took in one example of the flowers that had arrived for her, together with all her cards and telegrams and a couple of presents. The hospital had made her a cake; a large chocolate sponge, covered in rich chocolate icing; and Victoria brought in three helium filled balloons, a one and two zeros. We also took in a G&amp;T, Angela's mother's favourite tipple!<br /></p>
                  <p class="Title"><br /></p>
                  <p class="Title">In addition to a card from the Queen, she had a telegram from Ian Duncan Smith (on behalf or the Department for Work and Pensions) and a letter from Michael Gove (Department of Education), since she had been a teacher and gets a teacher's pension. There were then a surprising number of different cards with 100 on the front.<br /></p>
                  <p class="Title"><br /></p>
                  <p class="Title">So we sampled the cake, the birthday girl eat a crumb and sipped her G&amp;T and, feeling tired, was helped by the nurses back to bed. We then all went our separate ways, some to parties and the rest to our homes, in our case to wash up the remains of lunch, have a token New Year's Eve drink and look for entertainment on the television.<br /></p>
                  <p class="Title"><br /></p>
                  <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="Title">Half an hour of a 'Grumpy Old New Year' was reasonably funny, but then it began to pall. So we took Pip for his final saunter of 2010 (at 15 his walks are slow), enjoyed a soothing mug of hot chocolate and went to bed as Jools Holland started his programme. I understand that we missed some spectacular fireworks from London, but they are usually twice as long as necessary. I think that with fireworks it is the case of 'less is more', or am I just becoming a grumpy old man?</p>
